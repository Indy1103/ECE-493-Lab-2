• PASS — Use Case Aligned with Constitution-Justified Additions.

  The active use case is UC-10, and the specification restates the main success flow and the extension flow accurately: review
  form access, submission, validation, successful record/confirmation, and invalid/incomplete submission rejection with
  correction/resubmission. This matches AT-UC10-01 and AT-UC10-02.

  The core functional requirements are congruent with UC-10 intent. Additional requirements are present, including one-final-
  submission enforcement, submit-time eligibility revalidation, non-enumerating unauthorized feedback, explicit outcome
  handling, auditability, concurrency safety, encrypted transport/at-rest protections, and role-based submission control.
  These are not unjustified new features; they are Constitution-mandated or Constitution-permitted controls under security/
  confidentiality, RBAC, explicit error communication, and reliability/recoverability principles.

  I did not find requirements that are outside UC/TestSuite intent and also outside Constitution permission.
