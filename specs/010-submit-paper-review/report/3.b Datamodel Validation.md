• ### Architecture Alignment Summary
  plan.md is aligned with the Constitution’s intent. It explicitly uses the required React + TypeScript + PostgreSQL stack, enforces
  three-layer boundaries, and includes RBAC, validation, encryption, auditability, reliability, and acceptance-traceability gates. I
  did not find a plan-level architecture choice that contradicts a Constitution MUST.

  data-model.md is mostly congruent with spec.md in scope: it covers review submission, form rules, assignment eligibility, and
  auditable outcomes needed by UC-10 requirements. However, there is a terminology mismatch against the updated spec’s canonical
  failure vocabulary (validation-failed, session-expired, submission-unavailable): the data model uses outcome variants such as
  UNAVAILABLE_OR_NOT_FOUND, SUBMISSION_INELIGIBLE, and DUPLICATE_FINAL_SUBMISSION, which does not cleanly match the spec’s canonical
  terms. No clearly unjustified extra business entity was found, but the outcome taxonomy is inconsistent with the spec.

  ### Interface Alignment Summary

  The contract operations themselves are aligned with required behavior (retrieve form + submit review), and core success/validation/
  authorization/session scenarios are represented. But the response semantics are not fully congruent with the current spec language:
  the OpenAPI error codes include UNAVAILABLE_OR_NOT_FOUND, SUBMISSION_INELIGIBLE, and DUPLICATE_FINAL_SUBMISSION, while the spec now
  requires canonical failure outcome terms limited to validation-failed, session-expired, and submission-unavailable. This is a spec-
  contract misalignment in interface outputs.

  ### Fix 

  I’ll fix the misalignment by updating data-model.md and the OpenAPI contract so failure outcomes use the spec’s canonical
  vocabulary consistently, while keeping detailed cause information in a separate reason field.
