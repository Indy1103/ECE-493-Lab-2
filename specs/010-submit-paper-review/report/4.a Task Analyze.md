| C1 | Coverage Gap | HIGH | specs/010-submit-paper-review/spec.md:132, specs/010-submit-paper-review/tasks.md | SC-001 (95%
  submissions confirmed within 5s) has no explicit performance validation task. | Add a measurable performance test task
  (integration/load) tied to SC-001. |
  | C2 | Coverage Gap | MEDIUM | specs/010-submit-paper-review/spec.md:99, specs/010-submit-paper-review/tasks.md:114 | RAR-004
  requires backup/recovery inclusion; tasks only update recovery notes and do not explicitly verify restore for review records. | Add
  a restore-verification task scoped to review-submission data. |
  | I1 | Inconsistency | MEDIUM | specs/010-submit-paper-review/spec.md:18, specs/010-submit-paper-review/tasks.md:129 | Spec states
  stories must be independently testable, but task graph makes US2 depend on US1 baseline. | Clarify that US2 is independently
  testable with seeded endpoint baseline or split shared baseline into Foundational phase. |
  | D1 | Duplication | LOW | specs/010-submit-paper-review/spec.md:74, specs/010-submit-paper-review/spec.md:78 | FR-006 and FR-010
  partially overlap on failure outcome messaging. | Consolidate phrasing so FR-010 stays cross-path and FR-006 stays validation-
  specific. |
  | U1 | Underspecification | LOW | specs/010-submit-paper-review/spec.md:77, specs/010-submit-paper-review/tasks.md | FR-009
  (“available to editorial decision workflows”) is implemented implicitly via persistence, but no explicit integration verification
  task names editorial read path. | Add one explicit integration/assertion task that confirms editorial availability after
  submission. |

  Constitution Alignment Issues:
  Potential under-coverage against Constitution reliability/data-protection expectations: restore verification and measurable
  performance validation are not explicitly tasked.
  Unmapped Tasks:

  - T040 (quick verification checklist update) is process-supporting but not directly mapped to a single requirement key.

  Metrics:

  - Total Requirements: 33
  - Total Tasks: 40
  - Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task): 97% (32/33)
  - Ambiguity Count: 0
