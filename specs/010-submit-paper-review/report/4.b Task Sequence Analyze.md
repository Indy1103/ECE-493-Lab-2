• PASS — No Blocking Dependencies

  The tasks.md sequence is coherent and executable as written. Foundational prerequisites are explicitly placed before user-story
  work, and the phase dependency chain (Setup → Foundational → US1 → US2 → Hardening) is consistent with task order. Tasks that rely
  on prior artifacts reference outputs created earlier in sequence (for example, audit-logger, session-guard, and submission
  handlers), and no task depends on an output that is only introduced later. Parallel-marked tasks are explicitly identified as non-
  blocking, and there are no circular dependency patterns in the listed phases or task graph.
