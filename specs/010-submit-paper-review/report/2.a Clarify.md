## Question 1

• Recommended: Option B - Allow only one final submission per assignment and reject additional submissions with an explicit
  message; this minimizes conflicting records and aligns with “no duplicated final review records.”

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | Allow resubmissions and keep only the latest submission as final. |
  | B | Allow exactly one final submission; later attempts are rejected explicitly. |
  | C | Allow multiple submissions and keep full history for editorial view. |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words). |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or "recommended", or provide
  your own short answer.

  ### Response 

  B
## Question 2

  • Recommended: Option A - Revalidate assignment eligibility at submit time and reject stale/ineligible submissions; this
  prevents unauthorized/invalid records if assignment status changes after form load.

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | On submit, re-check assignment status/ownership; if no longer eligible, reject with explicit “assignment no longer
  eligible” outcome. |
  | B | Honor form-load snapshot and accept submission if it was eligible when opened. |
  | C | Accept submission but mark it “needs manual review” for editors. |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words). |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or "recommended", or provide
  your own short answer.

  ### Response 

  A

  ## Question 3 

 Recommended: Option B - Standardize denial feedback for non-owned or non-assigned submissions to a generic message; this
  reduces assignment-enumeration risk while still giving explicit guidance.

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | Return explicit “not authorized for this assignment” message. |
  | B | Return generic “submission unavailable for this assignment” message without confirming assignment existence. |
  | C | Return no specific message and redirect silently. |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words). |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or "recommended", or provide
  your own short answer.

### Response
