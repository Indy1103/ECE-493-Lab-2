• PASS — Use Case Aligned with Constitution‑Justified Additions.

  The specification restates UC‑16’s primary flow (notify → author requests → schedule presented) and the alternate flow where the
  schedule is not finalized. Functional requirements FR‑001 through FR‑005 match UC‑16 and AT‑UC16‑01/02, and FR‑006 preserves
  traceability as required.

  Additional requirements are present for security, reliability, and error handling. These are Constitution‑mandated constraints
  (encryption, RBAC, validation/error visibility, reliability/backup) and are not new user‑visible features. No unjustified
  additional behavior is introduced.
