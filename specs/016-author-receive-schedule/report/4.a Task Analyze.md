• ## Specification Analysis Report

  | ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
  |----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
  | C1 | Constitution | HIGH | spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md | Constitution requires public conference information to remain accessible
  without authentication, but spec and tasks assume authenticated author-only access for schedule viewing. This is a potential policy
  conflict for schedule visibility. | Clarify whether schedule is public info under policy or if author-only access is acceptable;
  update spec/plan/tasks accordingly. |
  | G1 | Coverage | MEDIUM | spec.md (Edge Cases), tasks.md | Edge case “schedule retracted or replaced” is not covered by any task
  or requirement. | Add a task or remove the edge case if it is not in scope. |
  | U1 | Underspec | MEDIUM | plan.md (Performance Goals), spec.md | “Standard web response expectations” is vague; success criteria
  are measurable but the plan language is ambiguous. | Replace with a measurable target or reference the SC‑002 time expectations. |

  Constitution Alignment Issues:

  Unmapped Tasks:

  - None detected, but FR‑006 has no explicit task.

  Metrics:

  - Total Requirements: 21
  - Total Tasks: 36
  - Coverage %: 76% (16/21) with several partials
  - Ambiguity Count: 1
  - Duplication Count: 0
  - Critical Issues Count: 0

  ## Next Actions

  - No CRITICAL issues. You may proceed, but consider resolving the public-access policy conflict and adding traceability coverage
    before /speckit.implement.
  - Suggested commands:
      1. Manually edit spec/plan/tasks to align schedule visibility with constitution.
      2. Manually add a traceability task for FR‑006.

  Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top 2 issues?
