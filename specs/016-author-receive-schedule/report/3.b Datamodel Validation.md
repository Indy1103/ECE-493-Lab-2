 ### Data Model Alignment Summary

  Aligned. The data model entities map to the spec’s needs: ConferenceSchedule and ScheduleEntry support schedule presentation and
  presentation details; SchedulePublication supports published/unpublished availability; AuthorNotification supports author
  notification. No extra entities or relationships introduce behavior beyond the spec.

  ### Interface Alignment Summary

  Aligned. The GET /author/schedule endpoint is sufficient for schedule retrieval, with explicit responses for unauthenticated/
  unauthorized users and unpublished schedules, matching FR‑002/FR‑003/FR‑005 and constitution‑mandated access control/error
  handling. No overexposed operations are present.

  ### Cross-Branch ER Feasibility Summary

  Not applicable. This step runs only if all feature branches are complete; multiple features remain incomplete, so cross‑branch
  aggregation cannot be validated.

  Outcome: PASS
