  Constitution Alignment Issues:
  - C1 (Test-first requirement violated by tasks; constitution non-negotiable).

  Unmapped Tasks:

  - None clearly unmapped; all tasks align to a requirement or plan constraint, but several requirements lack tasks.

  Metrics:

  - Total Requirements: 21
  - Total Tasks: 24
  - Coverage %: 67% (14/21)
  - Ambiguity Count: 0
  - Duplication Count: 0
  - Critical Issues Count: 1

  ## Next Actions

  - CRITICAL issues exist: resolve before /speckit.implement.
  - Recommended commands:
      - Run /speckit.tasks again with test tasks enabled (TDD), or manually add test tasks for US1/US2.
      - Manually add tasks to cover SPR-001/002/003, FR-009, AMR-001/003, and performance goal.

      1. Manually adjust tasks to ensure test-first ordering in Phase 2.
      2. Update plan or tasks to reconcile migration/infra paths.
      3. Add concrete verification tasks for encryption and log redaction.

Used recommended fixes

Top 3 Remediation Edits (proposed)

  1. Test‑first ordering in Phase 2 (Constitution CRITICAL)
      - File: specs/015-edit-conference-schedule/tasks.md
      - Change: Add failing tests for RBAC/validation/concurrency before T004–T007, or reorder Phase 2 to place tests before
        implementation tasks.
          - Insert new tasks like:
              - T005 [P] Add integration test for validation rejection in backend/tests/integration/
              - T006 [P] Add concurrency conflict test in backend/tests/integration/scheduleEdit.concurrency.int.test.ts
  2. Migration path mismatch (Plan vs Tasks)
      - Files: specs/015-edit-conference-schedule/plan.md, specs/015-edit-conference-schedule/tasks.md
      - Change: Align migration location. Either:
          - Option A: Update tasks to use infra/db/migrations/ (matching plan), or
          - Option B: Update plan’s structure to include backend/src/data/prisma/migrations/ (matching tasks).
      - Recommendation: If Prisma is the real tool, update plan structure to include Prisma migration location.
  3. Encryption/log redaction verification (SPR‑002/003)
      - File: specs/015-edit-conference-schedule/tasks.md
      - Change: Add concrete verification tasks, not just docs.
      - Example edits:
          - Add task: Add integration test to verify schedule edit payloads are redacted in logs in backend/tests/integration/
            scheduleEdit.redaction.int.test.ts
          - Add task: Add config check/assertion for encrypted storage for schedule tables in backend/src/data/prisma/
            encryptionCheck.ts

  ## Next Actions

  - No CRITICAL issues remain. You can proceed, but consider tightening non-functional verification:
      1. Add verification tasks for encryption-at-rest and log redaction.
      2. Define load parameters for the 5‑second performance goal.
      3. Align the TLS doc path with the plan’s infra structure.
