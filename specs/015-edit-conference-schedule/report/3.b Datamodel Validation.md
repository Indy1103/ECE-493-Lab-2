• Architecture Alignment Summary
  Aligned. plan.md uses the mandated three-layer web architecture, React + TypeScript, Fastify, and PostgreSQL, with explicit RBAC,
  encryption in transit/at rest, validation, auditability, and reliability considerations. No constitution constraints are
  contradicted.

  Data Model Alignment Summary
  Aligned. data-model.md includes ConferenceSchedule and ScheduleModificationRequest as required, and ScheduleEntry as a structural
  component of schedules (implied by “present schedule” and “modify schedule” requirements). No entities introduce new functional
  behavior beyond the spec. Relationships and state transitions support validation, finalization, and rejection flows.

  Interface Alignment Summary
  Aligned. contracts/openapi.yaml exposes only schedule retrieval and update endpoints required by FR-001..FR-008, with explicit
  400/401/403 error handling and finalization on success. No extra operations or capabilities beyond the spec are exposed.
