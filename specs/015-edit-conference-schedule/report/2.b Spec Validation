• FAIL — Unjustified Additional Behavior Detected.

  The specification aligns with UC‑15’s primary and extension flows for viewing the schedule, submitting modifications, applying
  valid changes, and rejecting invalid changes. However, it introduces additional behavior not required by UC‑15 or the acceptance
  tests: restricting editable elements to session/time/room only and rejecting stale edits via schedule versioning (optimistic
  concurrency). These constraints are not mandated by the Constitution either. Because these are user-visible behavior constraints
  not present in the UC or Test Suite, they constitute unjustified additional behavior, so the result is FAIL.

### Fix

Updated specs/015-edit-conference-schedule/spec.md to remove UC‑15‑external behavior:

  - Removed edit-scope restriction and stale‑version rejection.
  - Kept RBAC-only clarification (constitution-mandated).
  - Adjusted scenarios, edge case, and FRs accordingly.
  - Removed ScheduleVersion entity.

  Run the UC alignment validation again when ready.
