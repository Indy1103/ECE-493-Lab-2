## Question 1

 Recommended: Option B — Explicitly define the user-visible outcome when notification delivery fails to keep UX deterministic and
  testable.
  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | Silent failure (no user-visible indication anywhere) |
  | B | Show a banner in the author portal: “Decision notification failed; check decision status.” |
  | C | Send a follow-up in-app notification when delivery resumes |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or "recommended", or provide your own
  short answer.

  ### Response 

  B

## Question 2

  | B | Require explicit author login + ownership check; otherwise show generic unavailable |
  | C | Allow viewing decision via one-time token in notification link |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or "recommended", or provide your own
  short answer.
