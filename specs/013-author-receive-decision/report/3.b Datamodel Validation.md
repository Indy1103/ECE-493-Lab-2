### Architecture Alignment Summary
  principles. Security, RBAC, validation, and reliability constraints are explicitly included and no constitution-violating decisions
  are present.

  ### Data Model Alignment Summary

  The data model reflects the spec’s required concepts: author notification status, author decision view with accept/reject only,
  access requests, and user-visible outcomes. No extra entities introduce new user-visible behavior beyond the specification.

  ### Interface Alignment Summary

  The contract exposes only the author decision access operation with accept/reject outcomes and explicit notification-failure
  handling, consistent with UC-13 requirements and the clarified “accept/reject only” display rule. No overexposed operations are
  present.

  ### Cross-Branch ER Feasibility Summary

  A unified ER model remains feasible across existing feature data models. This feature’s notification and decision-access entities
  align with prior decision-related models and do not introduce conflicting keys or ownership semantics.

  Outcome: PASS — Architecture, models, and interfaces are aligned.
