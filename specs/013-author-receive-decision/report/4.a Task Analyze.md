 ## Specification Analysis Report

  | ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
  |----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
  | D1 | Duplication | LOW | specs/013-author-receive-decision/tasks.md (T035/T038/T040) | Three recovery-related tasks update the
  same recovery file, creating potential overlap. | Merge into one task or explicitly split “notes vs verification” responsibilities.
  |
  | U1 | Underspecification | MEDIUM | specs/013-author-receive-decision/tasks.md (T039) | “Library-first justification note” lacks a
  target section in plan.md. | Add a named subsection in plan.md and point T039 to it. |

  Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top 2 issues?

  PASS — The task sequence contains no blocking dependencies. Foundational setup precedes story work, and tasks that consume earlier
  artifacts appear after their prerequisites. Parallel-marked tasks are independent, and no circular dependencies are implied.
