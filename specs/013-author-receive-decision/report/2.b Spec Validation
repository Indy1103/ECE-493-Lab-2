PASS — The specification restates UC-13 for the main flow (notify author, author accesses decision, system presents acceptance/
  rejection) and the alternate flow (notification not delivered; author remains unaware). The functional requirements are congruent
  with UC-13 intent, including notification, decision access, ownership protection, and failure handling.

  Additional requirements are present around encrypted transport, encryption at rest, RBAC enforcement, explicit error messaging,
  auditability, and reliability. These are mandated by the Constitution’s security, validation, RBAC, and reliability principles and
  are not introduced as new user-visible features.

  No unjustified additional behavior is introduced, so the specification remains aligned with the Use Case.
