PASS — The task sequence contains no blocking dependencies. Foundational setup and prerequisite
controls appear before user-story work, user-story phases are ordered after foundational completion,
and cross-cutting validation is placed last. Dependencies referenced in the flow are either satisfied
earlier in sequence, explicitly marked parallelizable ([P]), or pre-existing (design artifacts listed
as prerequisites). No circular dependency or later-produced required artifact is assumed by an
earlier task.
