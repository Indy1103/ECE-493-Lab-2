### Architecture Alignment Summary

[plan.md](http://plan.md/) is Aligned with Constitution intent. It explicitly follows the mandated stack and constraints
traceable test-first delivery). No constitution-mandated architectural contradiction is evident.

### Data Model Alignment Summary

based access routing, and reliability/security expectations. No extra entity appears to introduce
unrelated user-visible behavior, and no required core entity appears missing.

### Interface Alignment Summary

contracts/user-login.openapi.yaml is now aligned with [spec.md](http://spec.md/) functional behavior and edge cases: it
exposes only the required login operation and supports success, invalid credentials, throttling,
operational failure, and role-mapping denial outcomes (200, 401, 429, 503, 403). Request/response
shapes remain consistent with the specified requirements and do not overexpose unrelated
capabilities.


PASS — Architecture, models, and interfaces are aligned.
