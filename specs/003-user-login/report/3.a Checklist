**You need to add the following to the specification to satisfy this checklist:**

- Define role-appropriate access boundaries with explicit role-to-permission constraints so authorization limits are objectively verifiable from requirement text.
- Add explicit measurable acceptance evidence that validates at-rest protection and no-plaintext handling requirements, not only transport and throttling outcomes.

This checklist does not pass because required security requirement-quality items are missing under Constitution authority. `/speckit.specify` should be re-run to add the missing required security precision and measurable validation language before implementation planning continues.

The following checklist IDs were detected and evaluated:
CHK001, CHK002, CHK003, CHK004, CHK005, CHK006, CHK007, CHK008, CHK009, CHK010, CHK011, CHK012, CHK013, CHK014, CHK015, CHK016
