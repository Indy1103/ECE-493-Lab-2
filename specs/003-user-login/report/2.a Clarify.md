### Clarify Question 1

```c
 ## Question 1: Login Identifier Definition

  Recommended: Option A - It aligns with the existing registration flow (which captures email) and
  avoids adding new identity fields or dual-lookup complexity.

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | Use email as the only login identifier. |
  | B | Use a dedicated username as the only login identifier. |
  | C | Allow either email or username. |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words). |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or
  "recommended", or provide your own short answer.
```

**Response: A**

### Clarify Question 2

```c
Recommended: Option B - A short temporary throttle on repeated failed attempts reduces credential-
  stuffing risk without creating long lockouts that can be abused for denial-of-service against
  legitimate users.

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | No additional failed-login throttling beyond invalid-credentials rejection. |
  | B | Apply temporary client-based throttling after repeated failed logins (time-window cooldown). |
  | C | Apply account-level lockout after repeated failed logins until admin/manual reset. |
  | D | Apply both client-based throttling and short account-level lockout. |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words). |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or
  "recommended", or provide your own short answer.
```

**Response B**

### Clarify Question 3

```c
• Recommended: Option C - This gives clear, testable thresholds with moderate abuse resistance and
  lower lockout friction for legitimate users compared with stricter policies.

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | Throttle after 3 failed attempts in 10 minutes for 15 minutes. |
  | B | Throttle after 5 failed attempts in 15 minutes for 15 minutes. |
  | C | Throttle after 5 failed attempts in 10 minutes for 10 minutes. |
  | D | Throttle after 10 failed attempts in 10 minutes for 5 minutes. |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words). |

```

  Notes:

  - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain.
  - No contradictory prior statements remain after updates.
  - Total accepted clarification questions remained within limit (3 <= 5).

  Recommendation:

  - Proceed to /speckit.plan.
  - Deferred items are planning-oriented (integration protocol/versioning details and explicit tradeoff
    rationale) and are better finalized in implementation planning.
