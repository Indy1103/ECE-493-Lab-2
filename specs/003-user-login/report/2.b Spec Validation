- FAIL — Unjustified Additional Behavior Detected.

The active use case is UC-03, and the specification does restate the primary and alternate login
flows in structure: successful authentication to a role-specific home page, and invalid-credential
rejection with no access. It also includes additional security, reliability, and error-handling
constraints (for example encrypted transport, plaintext protection, deterministic failure handling,
recoverability, and explicit error messaging) that are Constitution-mandated or Constitution-
permitted operational constraints, and these do not count as new user features.

However, the spec introduces an identity constraint that is not in UC-03 or AT-UC03-01/02 and is not
mandated by the Constitution: it changes login credentials from “username and password” to “email and
password” and makes email the canonical login identifier. Under the authority hierarchy, that is an
unjustified behavioral change relative to the active Use Case and Acceptance Test Suite. Therefore
the validation result is FAIL.

### Fix

Fixed by switching email to username as the usecase specifed 

### Rerun analysis

The active use case is UC-03, and the specification now matches its primary and alternate flows:
login initiation, username/password credential submission, credential verification, successful
authentication to a role-specific home page, and invalid-credential failure with no access. The
functional requirements for those flows are congruent with UC-03 and AT-UC03-01/02, and there is no
longer a conflicting email-only login rule.

Additional requirements do exist beyond the explicit UC text, but they are constitution-mandated or
constitution-permitted operational constraints rather than new user features. Specifically,
transport/data protection and no-plaintext handling align with Constitution security mandates;
deterministic failure outcomes, concurrency safety, recoverability, and retry-capable operational
error messaging align with reliability/error-communication mandates; and role-appropriate access
controls align with least-privilege authorization policy. The failed-login throttling requirement is
an allowed security/reliability safeguard under that constitution framework and does not introduce a
separate user-visible feature domain.

No unjustified additional behavior was detected.
