 The task sequence is coherent and executable as written. Foundational setup work is explicitly placed
  before all user-story phases, and later tasks that rely on prior artifacts (migrations, schema,
  business/data handlers, route handlers, UI integration, and hardening checks) appear after the
  prerequisites they depend on. Parallel-marked tasks are non-blocking from a sequencing perspective,
  and there are no circular or forward-only dependency assumptions that would force waiting on a later
  task output.
