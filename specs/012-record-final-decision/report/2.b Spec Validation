• PASS — The specification faithfully restates UC-12 for the primary flow (record final decision after reviews complete) and the
  alternate flow (block decision when reviews are pending). The functional requirements align with UC-12 intent, including gating on
  completed reviews, recording the decision, confirming it, and notifying the author.

  Additional requirements are present around encrypted transport, encryption at rest, RBAC enforcement, explicit error messages,
  auditability, and reliability under concurrency. These are not introduced as new user-visible features; they are mandated by the
  project Constitution’s security, validation, RBAC, and reliability principles.

  No unjustified additional behavior is introduced, so the specification remains aligned with the Use Case.
