  ### Data Model Alignment Summary

  The data model matches the spec’s required concepts: final decision record, decision request context, review completion status, and
  user-visible outcomes. The immutability rule and single final decision per paper directly support FR-003/FR-010, and review
  completion gating supports FR-002/FR-006/FR-011. No extra entities introduce new user-visible behavior beyond the spec.

  ### Interface Alignment Summary

  The contract exposes a single operation to record a final decision, with accept/reject as the only input options, which matches FR-
  004 and clarifications. The blocked outcomes (reviews pending, decision finalized) and unauthorized/session-expired errors align
  with the spec’s gating and RBAC requirements. No overexposed operations are present.
