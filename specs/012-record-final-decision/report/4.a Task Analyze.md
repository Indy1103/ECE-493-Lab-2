## Specification Analysis Report

  | ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
  |----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
  | D1 | Duplication | LOW | specs/012-record-final-decision/tasks.md (T036/T039/T041) | Three separate recovery-related tasks target
  the same recovery file, risking redundant or conflicting updates. | Merge into one recovery update task or split responsibilities
  clearly (notes vs verification). |
  | U1 | Underspecification | MEDIUM | specs/012-record-final-decision/tasks.md (T040) | “Library-first justification note” does not
  specify where in plan.md it should be recorded. | Anchor the note to a named section in plan.md or add a dedicated “Library-First
  Justifications” subsection. |
