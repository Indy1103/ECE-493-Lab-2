## Specification Analysis Report

  | ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
  |----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
  | C1 | Coverage Gap | CRITICAL | specs/014-generate-conference-schedule/tasks.md | Constitution requires tests first, but tasks
  explicitly mark tests as optional and include no test tasks. | Add test tasks per user story and mark them as failing before
  implementation. |
  | U1 | Underspecification | MEDIUM | specs/014-generate-conference-schedule/spec.md | Edge case includes “session capacity
  constraints,” but spec explicitly states no session/time assignment in UC-14, creating a vague, out-of-scope dependency. | Remove
  or defer this edge case to UC-15 (editing schedule) or clarify it as out of scope. |
  | A1 | Ambiguity | MEDIUM | specs/014-generate-conference-schedule/spec.md | Edge case “schedule generation fails due to missing
  session configuration data” conflicts with draft schedule scope (no session assignments), leaving failure conditions

  Coverage Summary Table:

  | Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |
  |-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|
  | fr-001 admin request generation | Yes | T010, T015 | Implemented via generation endpoint and UI. |
  | fr-002 verify accepted papers exist | Yes | T016 | Explicit check added in US2. |
  | fr-003 generate schedule incl. all accepted papers | Yes | T006, T007, T008 | Schema + repository + generation service. |
  | fr-004 present schedule to admin | Yes | T011, T015 | Retrieval endpoint and UI. |
  | fr-006 no schedule when none | Yes | T016 | Generation pre-check prevents creation. |
  | fr-009 restrict viewing to admins | Yes | T012 | RBAC enforced in route. |
  | spr-002 encrypt at rest | Partial | T021 | Only runbook verification; no implementation task. |

  | rar-003 backup/recovery coverage | Partial | T021 | Runbook verification only. |
  | amr-001 layer separation | Yes | T006–T011, T013–T015 | Layered tasks explicit. |

    conflict.

  Unmapped Tasks:

  - None detected. All tasks map to either functional requirements, RBAC/audit, or operational concerns.

  Metrics:

  - Total Requirements: 21 (FR 10 + SPR 4 + RAR 4 + AMR 4 + SC not mapped)
  - Total Tasks: 22
  - Coverage % (requirements with ≥1 task): ~67% (14/21)
  - Ambiguity Count: 1
  - Duplication Count: 0
  - Critical Issues Count: 1

  ### Next Actions

  - CRITICAL: Resolve the tests-first violation before /speckit.implement.
  - Recommended commands:
      - Run /speckit.tasks again with test tasks required.
      - Or manually add test tasks to specs/014-generate-conference-schedule/tasks.md and re-run /speckit.analyze.

  Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top 3 issues?

## Specification Analysis Report

  | ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
  |----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
  | A1 | Ambiguity | MEDIUM | specs/014-generate-conference-schedule/spec.md | Edge case “schedule generation fails due to missing
  session configuration data” conflicts with UC-14’s draft-only scope (no session/time assignments), leaving unclear whether session
  config is required. | Clarify that session configuration is not required for draft generation, or move this edge case to UC-15. |
  | U1 | Underspecification | MEDIUM | specs/014-generate-conference-schedule/spec.md | Edge case “generated schedule exceeds session
  capacity constraints” introduces constraints unrelated to draft-only generation, implying hidden requirements. | Remove or defer to
  UC-15; keep UC-14 scope limited to draft ordering. |
  | C1 | Coverage Gap | MEDIUM | specs/014-generate-conference-schedule/tasks.md | Non-functional requirements SPR-002, RAR-003, and
  AMR-003 are only partially reflected via documentation/runbook tasks; no explicit implementation or verification tasks exist. | Add
  explicit tasks to validate encryption-at-rest and backup/restore coverage and to document library choices/exceptions. |

  Constitution Alignment Issues:

  Unmapped Tasks:

  - None detected.

  Metrics:

  - Total Requirements: 21
  - Total Tasks: 31
  - Coverage % (requirements with ≥1 task): ~62% (13/21 fully covered; several partials)
  - Ambiguity Count: 1
  - Duplication Count: 0
  - Critical Issues Count: 0

  ### Next Actions

  - You can proceed to /speckit.implement with MEDIUM issues noted, but tightening the UC-14 edge cases and adding explicit non-
    functional verification tasks will reduce rework.
  - Suggested commands:
      - Run /speckit.specify to clarify edge-case scope for UC-14.
      - Manually update specs/014-generate-conference-schedule/tasks.md to add explicit NFR verification tasks.
