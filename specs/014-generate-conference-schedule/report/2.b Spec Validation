PASS — Use Case Aligned with Constitution-Justified Additions.

  The specification for specs/014-generate-conference-schedule/spec.md restates UC-14’s main success flow (generate schedule and
  present it to the administrator) and the extension flow for no accepted papers, aligning with AT-UC14-01 and AT-UC14-02. It adds
  additional requirements around RBAC, encryption, reliability, validation, auditability, and layered architecture, all of which are
  permitted or required by the Constitution (security, least-privilege, reliability, explicit error handling, and architecture
  boundaries). These additions are constraints, not new user-visible features. No unjustified behavior beyond UC-14 and the
  Constitution is introduced.
