• PASS — The task sequence contains no blocking dependencies. Phase ordering enforces setup and foundational work before user-story
  implementation, and test tasks precede implementation tasks within each story. Parallel markers are used only where work does not
  depend on later outputs. No circular dependencies or out-of-order prerequisites are indicated, so the task flow is coherent and
  executable as written.
