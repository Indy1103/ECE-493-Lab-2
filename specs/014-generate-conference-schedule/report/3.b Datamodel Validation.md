Architecture Alignment Summary
  The plan in specs/014-generate-conference-schedule/plan.md aligns with the Constitution: it uses the mandated React + TypeScript /
  PostgreSQL stack, preserves three-layer boundaries, enforces RBAC for scheduling, and explicitly covers validation, encrypted
  transport, reliability, and auditability. No constitution conflicts or tradeoffs are introduced.

  Data Model Alignment Summary
  specs/014-generate-conference-schedule/data-model.md matches the spec’s functional requirements: it defines draft schedules,
  ordered schedule entries, and accepted papers, with validation rules that enforce “accepted papers only,” draft status, and
  submission-time ordering. No extra entities introduce new user-visible behavior beyond UC-14, and the relationships are consistent
  with the spec’s scope.

  Interface Alignment Summary
  specs/014-generate-conference-schedule/contracts/openapi.yaml exposes only schedule generation and retrieval operations for
  administrators, includes explicit error responses for no accepted papers and authorization failures, and reflects the draft-only
  nature of UC-14. No overexposed operations or missing required operations are evident.
