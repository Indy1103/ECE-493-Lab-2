[tasks.md](http://tasks.md/) is coherent for sequential execution: setup tasks (T001–T006) establish project/test
scaffolding first, foundational prerequisites (T007–T020) are explicitly marked as blocking before
user stories, and all user-story tasks (T021–T048) occur after those prerequisites. Cross-cutting
validation/hardening tasks (T049–T054) are placed last and depend on outputs that are already
produced earlier in the sequence. Parallel-marked tasks ([P]) are explicitly identified as non-
blocking, and no circular dependency or later-produced required artifact was detected.
