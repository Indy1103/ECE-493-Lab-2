### Architecture Alignment Summary

[plan.md](http://plan.md/) is Aligned with Constitution intent. It uses the mandated three-layer web architecture and
the required platform stack direction (React + TypeScript + PostgreSQL), applies library-first
choices, and explicitly includes security, validation, RBAC, reliability, and traceability gates
consistent with Constitution principles.

### Data Model Alignment Summary

[data-model.md](http://data-model.md/) is congruent with [spec.md](http://spec.md/). Entities (RegistrationSubmission, UserAccount,
RegistrationThrottleRecord, RegistrationOutcome) directly support the functional requirements and
clarified behaviors (validation, duplicate email handling, throttling, deterministic outcomes). No
unjustified user-facing behavior was introduced by the data model; terminology is consistent with the
spec.

### Interface Alignment Summary

contracts/user-registration.openapi.yaml is aligned with [spec.md](http://spec.md/). The exposed operation (POST /api/
public/registrations) and response outcomes map to required registration flows (success, invalid
input, duplicate email, throttling, temporary failure). Inputs and outputs are consistent with
required fields and validation semantics, and no overexposed interface capability was detected.
