# Security Checklist: User Account Registration

**Purpose**: Validate security/privacy-related requirement quality in the registration spec for completeness, clarity, consistency, and measurable acceptance.
**Created**: 2026-02-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are confidentiality requirements defined for all registration data states (in transit, at rest, and in operational messages)? [Completeness, Spec §Security & Privacy Requirements, SPR-001, SPR-002, SPR-003]
- [ ] CHK002 Are requirements explicit about default account privilege level immediately after registration? [Completeness, Spec §Security & Privacy Requirements, SPR-004]
- [ ] CHK003 Are requirements defined for duplicate-account prevention under normalized email identity rules? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements, FR-008]
- [ ] CHK004 Are requirements defined for abuse resistance on repeated failed submissions, including threshold and cooldown window? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements, FR-013]
- [ ] CHK005 Does the spec define requirements for security-relevant operational failure messaging without exposing internal details? [Completeness, Gap, Spec §RAR-003, Spec §FR-007]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK006 Is "protected against unauthorized disclosure at rest" specific enough to identify covered storage classes (primary records, backups, temporary stores)? [Clarity, Ambiguity, Spec §SPR-002]
- [ ] CHK007 Is "plaintext" prohibition precise enough to distinguish credentials from non-sensitive registration metadata? [Clarity, Ambiguity, Spec §SPR-003]
- [ ] CHK008 Is the client identity basis for throttling sufficiently defined to avoid inconsistent enforcement interpretations? [Clarity, Ambiguity, Spec §FR-013]
- [ ] CHK009 Are password complexity requirements fully explicit and objectively interpretable (minimum length and composition)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-012]
- [ ] CHK010 Is immediate login eligibility clearly bounded so it cannot be interpreted as bypassing any stated security constraints? [Clarity, Spec §FR-011, Spec §Assumptions]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK011 Do user-visible validation error requirements align between functional and reliability sections without contradictory wording? [Consistency, Spec §FR-007, Spec §RAR-002, Spec §RAR-003]
- [ ] CHK012 Are duplicate-email requirements consistent across user stories, functional requirements, and success criteria? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 3, Spec §FR-008, Spec §FR-009, Spec §SC-003]
- [ ] CHK013 Do throttling requirements remain consistent between edge cases and functional requirements? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-010, Spec §FR-013]
- [ ] CHK014 Are security constraints consistent with assumptions about immediate login and non-privileged account defaults? [Consistency, Spec §SPR-004, Spec §Assumptions]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK015 Are security-related outcomes measurable in success criteria rather than implied only by narrative statements? [Acceptance Criteria, Gap, Spec §SC-001..SC-004]
- [ ] CHK016 Can each security-relevant requirement be objectively verified from requirement text alone (without inferred implementation behavior)? [Measurability, Spec §FR-008, Spec §FR-012, Spec §FR-013, Spec §SPR-001..SPR-004]
- [ ] CHK017 Are acceptance criteria explicitly traceable to alternate/error flows that include invalid input and duplicate identity handling? [Traceability, Spec §User Story 2, Spec §User Story 3, Spec §SC-002, Spec §SC-003]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK018 Are exception-flow requirements complete for invalid input, duplicate email, throttling, and temporary operational failure? [Coverage, Exception Flow, Spec §FR-006..FR-010, Spec §FR-013, Spec §RAR-003]
- [ ] CHK019 Are recovery expectations from blocked or failed registration states specified with clear user path semantics? [Coverage, Recovery, Spec §FR-010, Spec §RAR-003]
- [ ] CHK020 Are concurrency-related security scenarios (simultaneous duplicate-email submissions) explicitly covered by requirement language? [Coverage, Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §RAR-001]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK021 Are transport and data-protection requirements specific enough to serve as non-functional acceptance gates? [Non-Functional, Clarity, Spec §SPR-001, Spec §SPR-002, Spec §SPR-003]
- [ ] CHK022 Are reliability requirements sufficiently specific about deterministic outcome categories for security-relevant failures? [Non-Functional, Spec §RAR-002]
- [ ] CHK023 Does the spec explicitly define auditability/traceability expectations for security-relevant registration events, or is this currently implicit? [Non-Functional, Gap, Spec §AMR-003]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK024 Are security-sensitive assumptions (standard non-privileged role, immediate login eligibility) documented as assumptions rather than unstated defaults? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK025 Are dependencies on UC-02 and AT-UC02 acceptance IDs sufficient to validate all security-related requirement statements? [Dependency, Traceability, Spec §Dependencies, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK026 Is there any conflict between user guidance verbosity and protection against exposing sensitive operational details? [Conflict, Spec §FR-007, Spec §SPR-003]
- [ ] CHK027 Is "same client" in throttling requirements unambiguous enough to avoid conflicting interpretations across contexts? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-013]
- [ ] CHK028 Does the spec clearly separate user-facing registration failures from system-operational failures to prevent overlap ambiguity? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-006..FR-009, Spec §RAR-003]
