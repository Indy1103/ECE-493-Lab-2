### Plan Validation

- ### Architecture Alignment Summary

specs/005-submit-paper-manuscript/plan.md is aligned with the Constitution intent. It specifies the
required three-layer architecture, TypeScript/React + TypeScript backend stack, library-first
choices, RBAC-aware authorization, explicit validation/error behavior, encrypted storage assumptions,
auditability, and reliability/concurrency constraints. I did not find a Constitution-mandated
architecture constraint contradicted by the plan.

### Data Model Alignment Summary

specs/005-submit-paper-manuscript/data-model.md is congruent with specs/005-submit-paper-manuscript/
[spec.md](http://spec.md/). The entities map to required concepts in the spec (submission record, metadata package,
manuscript artifact, intake/cycle state, audit attempts), and key constraints support the functional
requirements (duplicate scope, normalization linkage, PDF/size constraints, deterministic
concurrency, atomic acceptance semantics). I did not identify missing required entities or
unjustified extra functional behavior.

### Interface Alignment Summary

specs/005-submit-paper-manuscript/contracts/manuscript-submissions.openapi.yaml is congruent with the
spec requirements. The submission POST operation and error surfaces align with metadata/file
validation, authorization failures, duplicate rejection, intake-closed behavior, and operational
failure handling. The requirements GET operation is consistent with the “system requests required
metadata and file requirements” flow and does not expose unrelated operations.
