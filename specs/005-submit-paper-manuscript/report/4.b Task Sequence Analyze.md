### Task Sequence

- PASS — No Blocking Dependencies

The task sequence is coherent and executable as written. Foundational setup tasks precede user-story tasks, user-story phases follow the declared phase dependencies, and polish tasks appear after story implementation. Dependencies implied by artifacts and decisions are either produced earlier in sequence (for example controllers/services/repositories before validation/hardening checks) or are explicitly non-blocking [P] parallel tasks. No circular dependencies or forward-only prerequisite violations were identified.
