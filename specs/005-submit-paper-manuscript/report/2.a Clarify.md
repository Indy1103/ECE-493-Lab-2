### ./Speckit.Clarify

### Clarify Question 1

```c
• Recommended: Option A - Using a fixed required metadata set per submission cycle gives deterministic
  validation, simpler acceptance testing, and fewer downstream review mismatches.

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | Fixed required metadata fields per submission cycle (same for all authors in that cycle) |
  | B | Role- or track-specific required metadata fields (vary by submission category) |
  | C | Fully dynamic metadata schema configurable at runtime |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or
  "recommended", or provide your own short answer.
```

**Response: A**

### Clarify Question 2

```c
 Recommended: Option B - Storing manuscript files in encrypted object storage and only keeping
  references in the submission record is the most scalable and auditable default for file-based
  workflows.

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | Store manuscript binary directly in primary relational database rows |
  | B | Store manuscript file in encrypted object storage and persist only file reference + integrity
  metadata in submission record |
  | C | Store files on application server local disk with periodic backup |
  | D | Allow either DB or object storage per deployment without a canonical default |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or
  "recommended", or provide your own short answer.
```

**Response B**

### Clarify Question 3

```c
• Recommended: Option A - Defining hard limits for file format and size now avoids ambiguous validation
  behavior and prevents mismatched acceptance tests.

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | Allow PDF only, max 20 MB |
  | B | Allow PDF/DOCX, max 20 MB |
  | C | Allow PDF only, max 50 MB |
  | D | Leave file format/size policy unspecified in this feature |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or
  "recommended", or provide your own short answer.
```

**Response A**

### Clarify Question 4

```c
Recommended: Option B - Preventing duplicate active submissions per author per conference cycle gives
  clear data integrity rules without blocking legitimate revised submissions after resolution
  workflows.

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | Allow duplicate submissions with same title by same author in the same cycle |
  | B | Reject duplicate active submissions with same normalized title by same author in the same cycle
  |
  | C | Reject any submission sharing title with any existing submission (global title uniqueness) |
  | D | Defer duplicate policy outside this feature |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or
  "recommended", or provide your own short answer.
```

**Response B**

### Clarify Question 5

```c
• Recommended: Option B - Requiring an audit event for each submission attempt outcome gives clear
  operational traceability for security, reliability, and dispute investigation without changing user-
  facing flow.

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | No explicit audit logging requirement in this feature |
  | B | Log each submission attempt outcome with timestamp, author ID, submission ID (if created), and
  failure reason code (no manuscript content) |
  | C | Log only successful submissions |
  | D | Log only failed submissions |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or
  "recommended", or provide your own short answer.
```

**Response B**
