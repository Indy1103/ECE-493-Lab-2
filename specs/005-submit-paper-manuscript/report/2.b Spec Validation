### Spec Analysis

PASS — Use Case Aligned with Constitution-Justified Additions.

The active use case is UC-05, and the specification correctly restates the primary flow and both
alternate/exception flows: successful submission with required metadata and valid file, rejection for
invalid/missing metadata with retry, and rejection for invalid file with retry. These are consistent
with AT-UC05-01, AT-UC05-02, and AT-UC05-03.

Additional behaviors are present beyond the literal UC/TestSuite wording (for example, encrypted
object storage handling, PDF/20MB policy, duplicate active-submission prevention, fixed per-cycle
metadata set, explicit audit logging, and reliability/error-handling controls). These are permissible
as Constitution-mandated or Constitution-allowed constraints for security, validation clarity,
reliability, and auditability, and therefore are not unjustified new user features.

One quality note is that the Key Entities section currently repeats Submission Metadata Package
multiple times with progressively refined wording, which is an internal spec duplication issue rather
than an unjustified behavior. This does not change the pass classification under your rule set.
