# Data Integrity Checklist: Submit Paper Manuscript

**Purpose**: Validate data-model and integrity requirement quality for manuscript submission behavior.
**Created**: 2026-02-10
**Feature**: `/Users/indy/Desktop/ECE 493 Lab/ECE 493 Lab 2/specs/005-submit-paper-manuscript/spec.md`

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are identity requirements fully specified for manuscript submission records (author identity, submission identity, and cycle identity)? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements FR-004/FR-015, Spec §Key Entities]
- [ ] CHK002 Are manuscript file persistence requirements complete about what is stored in submission records versus object storage? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements FR-013, Spec §Key Entities]
- [ ] CHK003 Are uniqueness requirements fully specified for duplicate active submissions, including normalization input and conference-cycle scope? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements FR-015]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK004 Is “normalized manuscript title” defined with explicit normalization rules (case, whitespace, punctuation, locale)? [Clarity, Spec §Functional Requirements FR-015, Gap]
- [ ] CHK005 Are the required metadata fields for an active submission cycle explicitly enumerated in requirements or referenced to a single authoritative policy source? [Clarity, Spec §Functional Requirements FR-012, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK006 Is “active submission” state clearly defined so duplicate checks are deterministic across statuses? [Clarity, Spec §Functional Requirements FR-015, Gap]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK007 Are metadata validation requirements consistent between story scenarios, edge cases, and FR-003/FR-006/FR-012? [Consistency, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK008 Are file validation requirements consistent between edge cases and FR-007/FR-014 (format and size limits)? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK009 Can each success criterion be evaluated objectively against data integrity outcomes without relying on unstated implementation assumptions? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria SC-001..SC-005]
- [ ] CHK010 Are acceptance criteria explicitly covering duplicate rejection behavior and fixed-cycle metadata consistency, or intentionally excluding them? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §Success Criteria, Gap]

## Scenario & Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK011 Are data-conflict scenarios fully covered for concurrent submissions with same normalized title by same author? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §Reliability & Availability Requirements RAR-001, Gap]
- [ ] CHK012 Are recovery requirements defined for partially persisted manuscript artifacts when metadata validation fails late? [Coverage, Spec §Reliability & Availability Requirements RAR-002/RAR-005, Gap]

## Dependencies, Assumptions & Ambiguities

- [ ] CHK013 Are dependencies on downstream referee assignment and review workflows sufficiently bounded to prevent integrity ambiguity at submission handoff? [Dependency, Spec §Dependencies]
- [ ] CHK014 Is the assumption that submission policy defines required metadata fields validated by a traceable policy source and change-governance requirement? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions, Gap]
