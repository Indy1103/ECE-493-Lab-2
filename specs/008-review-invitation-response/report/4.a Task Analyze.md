 ## Specification Analysis Report

  | ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
  |----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
  | C1 | Coverage Gap | MEDIUM | specs/008-review-invitation-response/plan.md:18, specs/008-review-invitation-response/
  tasks.md | Plan defines p95 latency target (<= 5s) but no explicit performance validation task is listed. | Add a concrete
  performance-verification task tied to SC-001/plan p95 target. |
  | A1 | Ambiguity | MEDIUM | specs/008-review-invitation-response/spec.md:147 | “95% of valid referee response attempts” does
  not define test population/window (“valid” denominator boundary). | Define denominator scope (e.g., acceptance test runs,
  load profile, time window). |
  | D1 | Duplication | LOW | specs/008-review-invitation-response/spec.md:79-84 | Concurrent-response edge case appears twice
  (general statement + clarified variant). | Keep one canonical phrasing and reference first-response-wins once. |

  ### Metrics

  - Total Requirements: 25
  - Total Tasks: 60
  - Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task): 100%
  - Ambiguity Count: 1
  - Duplication Count: 1
  - Critical Issues Count: 0

  ### Next Actions

  No CRITICAL blockers detected; implementation can proceed.
  If desired, improve precision before /speckit.implement by tightening SC-001 denominator language and adding a specific
  performance-validation task aligned to plan p95 target.

  Suggested commands:

  1. Run /speckit.specify with refinement
  2. Run /speckit.tasks (if tasks are regenerated after spec refinement)
  3. Or manually update specs/008-review-invitation-response/spec.md and specs/008-review-invitation-response/tasks.md
