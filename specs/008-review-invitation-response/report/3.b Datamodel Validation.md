plan.md is Aligned with Constitution-Justified Tradeoffs.
  RBAC, explicit validation, encrypted transport/at-rest posture, auditability, and concurrency safety. The row-level
  requirements rather than conflicting with constitution intent.

  data-model.md is broadly congruent with spec.md and supports UC-07 requirements (atomic assignment, workload/capacity
  checks, duplicate rejection, invitation handling, audit outcomes).
  No clearly missing required entities were found.
  Notable “extra scope” entities/states exist (AssignmentAttemptAudit, extended lifecycle states such as DECLINED/COMPLETED,
  IN_REVIEW/CLOSED), but they are consistent with stated reliability/audit requirements and downstream workflow assumptions,
  not contradictory new behavior.

  ### Interface Alignment Summary

  contracts/referee-assignments.openapi.yaml is mostly aligned with spec.md: it exposes assignment-option retrieval and atomic
  assignment submission, with validation/auth/authorization/capacity/concurrency error paths.
  One caution: the options response includes richer referee data (displayName, workload fields, eligibility) than the minimum
  explicitly required by FR-002; this is plausible under “assignment options” but is broader than the minimum spec wording.
