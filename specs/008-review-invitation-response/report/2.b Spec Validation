 PASS — Use Case Aligned with Constitution-Justified Additions.

The active use case is UC-08. The specification restates the main flow accurately: the referee accesses an invitation, sees
details, accepts or rejects, the system records the decision, and confirms recording. It also captures both UC-08 alternate
branches correctly: rejection results in no assignment, acceptance results in paper association. The failed end condition is
also represented: when recording fails, the invitation remains unresolved.

The functional requirements are congruent with UC intent. The core decision and outcome requirements (accept, reject,
assignment/no-assignment, confirmation, unresolved-on-failure) are use-case-mandated behavior. The additional constraints
about invitation ownership checks, non-pending invitation rejection, first-valid-response-wins under concurrency, explicit
failure state messaging, and no side effects on failed recording are not new user features; they are constitution-mandated
or constitution-permitted reliability, security, authorization, and explicit-error behaviors.

Additional requirement groups in the spec (security/privacy, reliability/availability, maintainability/auditability) are
constitution-justified operational constraints and do not introduce unjustified new user-visible features. No invalid
behavior was detected that falls outside UC/TestSuite intent and Constitution authority.
