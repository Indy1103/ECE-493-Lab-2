  ### Data Model Alignment Summary

  data-model.md is congruent with spec.md functional requirements. The entities (ReviewInvitation, InvitationResponseAttempt,
  RefereeAssignment) directly support accept/reject recording, ownership checks, unresolved-on-failure behavior, and conflict
  handling. No required entity appears missing. The InvitationResponseAttempt audit entity is an additional model element, but
  it is justified by Constitution-mandated auditability/reliability expectations rather than introducing new user-visible
  feature behavior.

  ### Interface Alignment Summary

  The contracts expose only operations required by the specification: retrieving invitation details and submitting accept/
  reject responses. Request/response structures and error paths align with requirements for ownership authorization, pending-
  state validation, conflict handling, and failure feedback. No overexposed operation that enables out-of-scope behavior was
  detected.

  ### Cross-Branch ER Feasibility Summary (if applicable)

  The conditional cross-branch ER aggregation step is not applicable yet because all feature specs are currently marked
  Status: Draft, so “all feature branches complete” is not satisfied.
