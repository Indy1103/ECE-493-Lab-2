## Question 

Recommended: Option A - It minimizes race-condition risk and makes acceptance tests deterministic by enforcing exactly one
  authoritative decision per invitation.

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | First valid response wins; later responses are rejected as already resolved. |
  | B | Last response within a short window wins; invitation state can change once before final lock. |
  | C | Allow override only by explicit admin/editor action after referee response. |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words). |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or "recommended", or provide
  your own short answer.

### Response 

A 

## Question 2

Recommended: Option B - Defining a minimum required invitation-detail set keeps behavior testable and avoids disputes about
  what “enough detail” means for a referee decision.

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | Show only paper title and decision buttons. |
  | B | Show paper title, abstract/summary, review due date, and response deadline. |
  | C | Show full manuscript content in the invitation view. |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words). |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or "recommended", or provide
  your own short answer.

  ### Response

  B

  ## Question 3

  • Recommended: Option A - This is the safest and most predictable user contract: if recording fails, no assignment side effect
  should exist, preventing hidden partial state.

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | On recording failure, no assignment is created/retained and invitation remains pending. |
  | B | Assignment may still be created, but invitation remains pending until retry succeeds. |
  | C | Mark invitation as failed terminally and block retry without admin intervention. |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words). |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or "recommended", or provide
  your own short answer.

  ### Response 

A

  Coverage summary:

  |---|---|
  | Functional Scope & Behavior | Resolved |
  | Domain & Data Model | Clear |
  | Interaction & UX Flow | Resolved |
  | Non-Functional Quality Attributes | Resolved |
  | Integration & External Dependencies | Deferred |
  | Edge Cases & Failure Handling | Resolved |

  Notes:

  - Deferred: Integration/external dependency failure modes were not critical blockers for spec correctness at this stage and
    are better expanded during planning.
  - No outstanding critical ambiguities remain for proceeding.
