• PASS — The task sequence contains no blocking dependencies.

  Phase-level ordering is coherent: setup precedes foundational, foundational blocks all user stories, and polish depends on
  completed stories. Within stories, tests are listed before implementation, and implementation artifacts referenced later are
  produced earlier in the sequence (or are pre-existing project artifacts like quickstart.md, runbooks, and package config
  files). Parallel-marked tasks are independent by file scope and do not create circular prerequisites.

  No task was found to require an output that is only produced by a later task, and no circular dependency is present in the
  explicit dependency graph.
