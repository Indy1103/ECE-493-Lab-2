PASS — The task sequence contains no blocking dependencies.

  All prerequisite-producing work appears earlier in the sequence or is explicitly framed as parallel/non-blocking:

  - Foundational prerequisites are before all story phases.
  - Story implementation tasks follow their story test setup and foundation.
  - Cross-cutting Phase 6 tasks depend on outputs already established in Phases 2–5 (e.g., repository, route handlers,
    invitation service, ops docs).
  - No task was found to require an artifact produced only by a later task.
  - No circular dependency pattern was detected in the explicit phase/story dependency graph.

  The workflow is coherent and executable as written.
