## Question 1

ecommended: Option A - It best matches UC-07-S2 wording (“No referee is assigned as a result of this
  attempt”), keeps outcomes deterministic, and reduces partial-update/recovery complexity.

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | Atomic assignment: if any selected referee fails validation, reject the entire request and
  assign none. |
  | B | Partial assignment: assign valid referees, reject only invalid ones, and report mixed outcome.
  |
  | C | Conditional partial assignment: allow partial assignment only when editor explicitly enables it
  per request. |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words). |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or
  "recommended", or provide your own short answer.

  ### Response 
    A

  ## Question 2

  • Recommended: Option B - It preserves assignment integrity and aligns with reliability/auditability
  constraints by avoiding rollback ambiguity after commit while still giving explicit failure handling.

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | Assignment and invitation are atomic: if any invitation fails, no assignments are persisted. |
  | B | Assignment commit is authoritative; invitation failures do not undo assignments and must
  trigger explicit retryable failure handling. |
  | C | Best-effort invitations with no explicit retry requirement. |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words). |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or
  "recommended", or provide your own short answer.

  ### Response

  B

  ## Question 3

   Recommended: Option A - It prevents inconsistent assignment records and keeps validation
  deterministic for both UX and testing.

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | Reject request when duplicate referee identifiers are present in the same submission, with
  explicit duplicate-entry feedback. |
  | B | Auto-deduplicate duplicate identifiers and continue validation silently. |
  | C | Auto-deduplicate but show a warning and continue. |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words). |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or "no"

  ### Response 

  A

---

• Recommended: Option B - A per-paper lock/window is simpler to reason about than optimistic conflict
  retries and best protects max-referee limits under concurrent editor actions.
  |--------|-------------|
  | C | Last-write-wins for concurrent assignment attempts. |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words). |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or
  "recommended", or provide your own short answer.
