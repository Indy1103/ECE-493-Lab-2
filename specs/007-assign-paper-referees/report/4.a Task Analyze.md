## Specification Analysis Report
  | ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
  paper-referees/tasks.md | SPR-001 (encrypted transport) has no explicit implementation or verification task coverage. | Add
  explicit TLS enforcement and test tasks mapped to SPR-001. |
  rest encryption implementation/verification task. | Add concrete storage-at-rest protection and validation tasks. |
  tasks.md:143-149 | Stories are framed as independently testable, but dependency graph forces US2 and US3 to depend on US1. |
  Remove non-essential US2/US3 dependency on US1 or justify as hard technical prerequisite. |
  | U1 | Underspecification | MEDIUM | specs/007-assign-paper-referees/spec.md:118, specs/007-assign-paper-referees/
  plan.md:22-23, specs/007-assign-paper-referees/tasks.md:66,135 | Retryable invitation handling exists, but retry policy
  details (max attempts/backoff/final failure behavior) are not concretely specified. | Specify retry policy parameters in
  spec and align tasks to those parameters. |
  | A1 | Ambiguity | MEDIUM | specs/007-assign-paper-referees/spec.md:93 | FR-004 references “assignment rules” without
  listing complete rule inventory in one place. | Add explicit canonical rule list or cross-reference table. |
  | A2 | Ambiguity | MEDIUM | specs/007-assign-paper-referees/spec.md:151-155 | Success criteria use “100% of tested
  scenarios” but denominator/scope is not defined. | Define test population/suite boundaries for each SC item. |
  | E1 | Coverage Gap | MEDIUM | specs/007-assign-paper-referees/spec.md:125, specs/007-assign-paper-referees/tasks.md | AMR-
  003 traceability requirement has no explicit task for maintaining requirement→test trace matrix. | Add traceability
  maintenance/check task (UC/AT mapping evidence). |
  | D1 | Duplication | LOW | specs/007-assign-paper-referees/spec.md:114,119 | RAR-001 and RAR-006 partially overlap on
  concurrent same-paper safety/serialization. | Consolidate wording or clarify distinction (outcome integrity vs mechanism). |

  ### Metrics

  - Total Requirements: 28
  - Total Tasks: 56
  - Coverage % (requirements with >=1 mapped task): 92.9% (26/28)
  - Ambiguity Count: 2
  - Duplication Count: 1
  - Critical Issues Count: 2

  ## Next Actions

  - CRITICAL issues exist; resolve before /speckit.implement.
  - Suggested commands:

  1. Run /speckit.specify to tighten SPR-001/SPR-002 and retry-policy specificity.
  2. Run /speckit.plan to align story independence/dependency intent.
  3. Manually update specs/007-assign-paper-referees/tasks.md to add explicit TLS/at-rest/traceability tasks.

  Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top 5 issues?

  ---

  Proposed remediation edits for the top 5 issues (no files changed):
  1. Add explicit TLS coverage (CRITICAL)

  - In specs/007-assign-paper-referees/tasks.md Phase 6, add:
      - - [ ] T057 [P] Add failing integration test enforcing TLS-only access for referee assignment endpoints in \backend/
        tests/integration/referee-assignments/transportSecurity.integration.test.ts``
        assignments/refereeAssignmentRouteSecurity.ts``
  2. Add explicit at-rest protection implementation + verification (CRITICAL)
  - In specs/007-assign-paper-referees/tasks.md Phase 6, add:
      - - [ ] T059 [P] Add integration test verifying assignment/invitation sensitive fields are protected at rest per
      - - [ ] T060 Implement persistence-layer hooks/config wiring for at-rest protection assertions in \backend/src/data/


      - US1 -> US2 and US1 -> US3
      - Phase 2 -> US1, US2, US3
      - Optional note: “US2/US3 may reuse components from US1 but are independently implementable/testable.”

  4. Make retry policy explicit (MEDIUM)

  - In specs/007-assign-paper-referees/spec.md, add under Reliability requirements:
      - RAR-007: Retryable invitation handling MUST define retry owner, retry cadence/backoff, maximum attempts, and terminal
        failure status behavior.
  - In tasks.md, add:
      - - [ ] T061 [US1] Implement configured retry policy (max attempts/backoff/terminal state) in \backend/src/business/
        referee-assignments/InvitationDispatchService.ts``
      - - [ ] T062 [P] [US1] Add integration test for retry budget exhaustion to terminal failure state in \backend/tests/
        integration/referee-assignments/invitationRetryBudget.integration.test.ts``

  5. Add explicit traceability maintenance task (MEDIUM)

  - In specs/007-assign-paper-referees/tasks.md Phase 6, add:
      - - [ ] T063 Maintain requirement-to-test traceability matrix for UC-07 and AT-UC07-01/02/03 in \specs/007-assign-paper-
        referees/quickstart.md``
  - Optional: include a compact table mapping FR/SPR/RAR/AMR IDs to task IDs and test files.

  |----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
  | A1 | Ambiguity | HIGH | specs/007-assign-paper-referees/spec.md:93 | FR-004 says “assignment rules” but no single
  canonical rule list is defined in one place. | Add explicit rule inventory (duplicate, workload, capacity, eligibility,
  state) or a normative reference section. |
  | U1 | Underspecification | HIGH | specs/007-assign-paper-referees/spec.md:120, specs/007-assign-paper-referees/
  tasks.md:142-143 | RAR-007 requires retry policy definition, but spec still lacks concrete values (attempt count/backoff
  intervals/owner trigger conditions). | Define concrete retry policy parameters in spec to make acceptance objective. |
  | A2 | Ambiguity | MEDIUM | specs/007-assign-paper-referees/spec.md:152-156 | Success criteria use “100% of tested …”
  without explicit denominator/suite boundary. | Specify exact test population/source (e.g., AT suite IDs + concurrency
  matrix). |
  | D1 | Duplication | LOW | specs/007-assign-paper-referees/spec.md:114,119 | RAR-001 and RAR-006 overlap on concurrent same-
  paper safety. | Keep both but distinguish outcome requirement vs mechanism requirement explicitly. |
  | E1 | Coverage Gap | MEDIUM | specs/007-assign-paper-referees/plan.md:18, specs/007-assign-paper-referees/tasks.md | Plan
  sets p95 response goal, but no explicit performance verification task exists. | Add a measurable performance-validation task
  tied to the p95 target. |

  ## Next Actions

  - No CRITICAL blockers; implementation can proceed.
  - Recommended before /speckit.implement:

  1. Clarify canonical assignment-rule inventory in spec.md.
  2. Quantify RAR-007 retry parameters in spec.md.
  3. Add/align a performance verification task for plan p95 goal.
