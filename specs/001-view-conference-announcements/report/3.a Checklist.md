  ## Checklist Summary

  | Category | Count |
  | Satisfied | 6 |
  | Missing but Required | 5 |
  | Missing but Not Required | 9 |
  (Natural Language)

  You need to add the following to the

    requirements for each public-read
    outcome state: available
    announcements, empty result,
    retrieval error, and throttled
    response.
  - Add explicit traceability so primary,
    alternate, and exception paths are
    all linked to use-case and
    acceptance-test identifiers.
  - State expected behavior when
    announcements exist but all are
    future-dated public records,
    including how that maps to the
  - Link plan-level API non-functional
    success expectation, and transport
    security.
  - Expand operational assumptions to
    source, network access, or clock
    assumptions are violated.

  ## Human-Readable Summary (Lab-Ready)

  This checklist does not pass: 14 of 20
  items are unsatisfied, and 5 of those
  are required by UC-01/AT-UC01 or the
  constitution. The specification should
  be updated and /speckit.specify re-run
  to add the required missing API-state
  definition, traceability for exception
  paths, future-dated visibility
  behavior, spec-level non-functional
  linkage, and explicit dependency-impact
  assumptions.

### Required Remediation Summary (Natural Language)

You need to add the following to the specification to satisfy this checklist:

- State the transport-security protocol expectation explicitly for this feature’s public access paths (for example, that access
  must use TLS-only endpoints) so encrypted-transport verification is unambiguous.

### Human-Readable Summary (Lab-Ready)

This checklist does not pass because one required security item is missing: the encrypted-transport requirement is not explicit
enough to verify protocol expectations against constitutional security policy. Other security-detail gaps are present but are not
strictly required by UC-01, its acceptance tests, or constitution mandates for this feature scope. /speckit.specify should be re-
run to add the missing explicit transport-security wording.
