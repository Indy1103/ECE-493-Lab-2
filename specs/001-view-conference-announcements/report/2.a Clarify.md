## Question 1


Recommended: Option B - It gives deterministic behavior for both future and expired announcements,
which reduces edge-case bugs and makes acceptance tests unambiguous.

For “currently publicly available announcements,” which eligibility rule should the spec enforce?

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A | is_public = true only; publication timing is ignored |
| B | is_public = true and current time is within [publish_start, publish_end] (end optional) |
| C | is_public = true and publish_start <= now; no end/expiry support |
| D | Manual “published” state only; no time-based logic |
| Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) |

You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or
"recommended", or provide your own short answer.
  

  ### Response 

  B

## Question 2

  • Recommended: Option B - A p95 <= 2s target is a strong baseline for public read endpoints without
  over-constraining implementation early, and it gives clear performance acceptance criteria.

  What response-time target should the spec require for loading public announcements under normal
  operating load?

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | p95 page/API response <= 1 second |
  | B | p95 page/API response <= 2 seconds |
  | C | p95 page/API response <= 3 seconds |
  | D | No explicit latency SLO |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or
  "recommended", or provide your own short answer.
  ### Response 

  B

## Question 3

• Recommended: Option B - It provides enough operational signal to detect and diagnose outages quickly
  while keeping scope reasonable for a public read feature.

  For announcement retrieval failures, what observability requirement should the spec enforce?

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | No explicit observability requirement |
  | B | Structured error logs + failure-rate metric + alert threshold |
  | C | Structured error logs only |
  | D | Failure-rate metric only |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or
  "recommended", or provide your own short answer.


### Response 

B

## Question 4

• Recommended: Option B - It gives a concrete, realistic baseline for acceptance/performance testing
  and is strong enough to catch inefficient query/render paths early.

  How should the spec define “normal operating load” for the p95 <= 2s performance requirement?

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | 50 concurrent anonymous users |
  | B | 100 concurrent anonymous users |
  | C | 200 concurrent anonymous users |
  | D | 500 requests/min average, burst to 1,000 requests/min |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or
  "recommended", or provide your own short answer.


  ### Response 

  B
