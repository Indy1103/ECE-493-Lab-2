The active use case is UC-01 (View Conference Announcements), and the specification faithfully restates the primary flow (public access, display announcements, read announcements) and the alternate flow (no announcements message, no content shown) in alignment with [UseCases.md](http://usecases.md/) and [TestSuite.md](http://testsuite.md/). The functional baseline is congruent with UC intent: anonymous access and readable public announcements are preserved, and the “available announcements” rule is a concrete definition of UC-01’s “publicly available” behavior rather than a new user-facing capability.

Additional behavior is present, but it is Constitution-justified: retrieval-failure handling and
explicit error messaging, transport/security/privacy constraints, concurrency/availability/recovery expectations, observability and alerting, performance targets, and architecture/traceability controls align with Constitution principles on security, explicit error communication, reliability/availability, layered architecture, and acceptance traceability. These are operational constraints, not new user-visible features.
