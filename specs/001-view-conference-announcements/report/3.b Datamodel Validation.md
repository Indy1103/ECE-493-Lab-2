**Architecture Alignment Summary**
The architecture aligns with [spec.md](http://spec.md) through its PostgreSQL foundation, library-first approach, clear public-access/RBAC boundaries, TLS/security posture, validation/error behavior, and reliability/observability constraints—all without contradicting any constitutional mandate.

**Data Model Alignment Summary**
[data-model.md](http://data-model.md/) aligns with [spec.md](http://spec.md/). Required concepts are covered: ConferenceAnnouncement, anonymous PublicUser, and deterministic availability outcome states. Fields and relationships support FR-001 through FR-007. No required entity is missing. No unjustified functional behavior exists; derived internal announcement lifecycle states support the spec without expanding scope.

**Interface Alignment Summary**
contracts/public-announcements.openapi.yaml aligns with [spec.md](http://spec.md/). It exposes only the required public read operation (GET /api/public/announcements), supports the required outcomes (available, empty, retrieval failure), uses no authentication for this endpoint, and exposes no operations beyond scope.
