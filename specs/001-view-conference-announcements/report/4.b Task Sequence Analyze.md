 I validated all listed tasks in [tasks.md](http://tasks.md/) for ordering and dependency logic. Foundational work is
explicitly gated before story work, and the additional Phase 2 test gate (T042–T044 before T006–T015)
is stated and placed correctly in sequence. User story implementation flows and Phase 5 validation/
polish tasks depend only on outputs that appear earlier in the sequence (or are explicitly marked
parallel/external in the document), and no circular dependency is present.
