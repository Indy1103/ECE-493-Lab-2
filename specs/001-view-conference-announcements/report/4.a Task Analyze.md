  ### Constitution Alignment Issues
  - C2: Responsive layout mandate is missing from spec/tasks.
  - C3: TLS requirement lacks explicit enforcement/verification tasks.

  - None fully unmapped; some setup/polish tasks primarily map to constitutional quality gates rather
    than explicit FR/NFR text.

  ### Metrics

  - Total Requirements: 24
  - Total Tasks: 41
  - Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task): 87.5% (21/24)
  - Ambiguity Count: 3
  - Duplication Count: 2
  - Critical Issues Count: 3

  ## Next Actions

  - CRITICAL issues exist; resolve before /speckit.implement.
  - Suggested commands:

  1. Run /speckit.specify to refine requirements and acceptance scenarios (US2 failure path, ambiguity
     cleanup, responsive/TLS explicitness).
  2. Run /speckit.plan to add concrete architecture/security/availability verification strategy.
  3. Manually update specs/001-view-conference-announcements/tasks.md to add missing coverage tasks
     (TLS, responsive checks, availability/recovery verification, Phase 2 red-first tests, [P]
     correction).

  Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top 5 issues?

  ## Resolving

 

```c
• Top 5 Remediation Edits (Concrete, Read-Only Suggestions)
  1. Enforce Red-First before Phase 2 behavior work (C1)

  - Edit specs/001-view-conference-announcements/tasks.md.

  - [ ] T006A Add failing unit test for eligibility-window rule behavior in `backend/tests/unit/
  publicAnnouncementEligibility.unit.test.ts`
  `backend/tests/integration/public-announcements.route-foundation.integration.test.ts`
  `backend/tests/integration/public-announcements.observability-foundation.integration.test.ts`
  - Add dependency note in tasks.md under “Within Each User Story” or Phase 2 notes:

  - Phase 2 implementation tasks (T006-T015) start only after T006A-T006C are failing.

  2. Add responsive requirement and coverage (C2)
  - Edit specs/001-view-conference-announcements/spec.md under NFRs (Architecture/Maintainability or

  desktop and mobile viewports (minimum widths: 375px mobile, 1280px desktop) with all announcement

  - [ ] T042 [P] Add responsive e2e viewport tests (mobile + desktop) for AVAILABLE/EMPTY/FAILURE
  - [ ] T043 [P] Add CI step to run responsive e2e checks in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  3. Add explicit TLS enforcement + verification tasks (C3)

  - Edit specs/001-view-conference-announcements/tasks.md Phase 2/5:

  monitoring/public-announcements-https-policy.md` and runtime config under `backend/src/presentation/
  - [ ] T045 [P] Add integration/security test rejecting non-TLS access headers/proto mismatch in

  - Optional spec tightening in spec.md (SPR-001 note):

  Verification: automated integration test MUST assert endpoint behavior under non-TLS request context.

  - **RAR-003**: During CMS operational windows, public announcement endpoint monthly availability MUST
  be >= 99.9%, excluding planned maintenance windows.

  - Edit tasks.md Phase 5:

  - [ ] T046 Define and validate announcement endpoint availability SLI/SLO and alert thresholds in
  `infra/ops/monitoring/public-announcements-slo.yml`
  - [ ] T047 [P] Add synthetic availability probe for public announcements endpoint in `infra/ops/
  monitoring/public-announcements-availability-probe.yml`

  5. Cover recovery behavior verification (G2 / RAR-004)

  - Edit tasks.md Phase 4 or Phase 5:

  - [ ] T048 Add integration test validating automatic recovery from transient repository failure to
  normal AVAILABLE/EMPTY responses in `backend/tests/integration/public-
  announcements.recovery.integration.test.ts`
  - [ ] T049 Add fault-injection test scenario for temporary retrieval outage and recovery in `backend/
  tests/integration/public-announcements.fault-recovery.integration.test.ts`

  - Tighten spec.md RAR-004 with measurable target:

  Recovery objective: after transient dependency recovery, normal read behavior is restored within 60
  seconds without operator intervention.
