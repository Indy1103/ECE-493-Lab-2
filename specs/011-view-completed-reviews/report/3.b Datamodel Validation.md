### Architecture Alignment Summary


  ### Data Model Alignment Summary

  Validation cannot be completed because specs/011-view-completed-reviews/data-model.md is missing. Without the data model, entity
  coverage and relationship congruence with spec.md cannot be confirmed.

  Validation cannot be completed because specs/011-view-completed-reviews/contracts/ is missing. Without contracts, interface
  alignment to the functional requirements in spec.md cannot be assessed.

  ### Cross-Branch ER Feasibility Summary (if applicable)

  The conditional cross-branch check is not applicable yet: required data-model.md files for this feature are missing, and the
  specified specs/*/data_model.md input pattern yields no files. A unified ER feasibility assessment cannot be determined at this
  time.

  FAIL — Misalignment detected due to missing required artifacts (data-model.md and contracts/), which prevents validating data model
  and interface congruence with the specification.

  completion status, and view requests). Completion gating and anonymization rules are encoded in validation rules that align with
  FR-006 and FR-011. No extra entities introduce new functional behavior beyond the specification, and terminology remains
  consistent.

  ### Interface Alignment Summary

  The OpenAPI contract aligns with the functional requirements. It exposes only the editor review-visibility retrieval operation and
  encodes the specified outcomes: success with anonymized reviews (REVIEWS_VISIBLE), pending reviews with no content
  (REVIEWS_PENDING), and generic unavailable/denied outcomes for unauthorized or inaccessible access. Session-expired outcomes are
  also explicitly represented. No overexposed operations are present.

  ### Cross-Branch ER Feasibility Summary (if applicable)

  The conditional cross-branch aggregation step cannot be completed as specified because the required input pattern (specs/*/
  data_model.md) does not match the repository’s data-model.md naming. Therefore, unified ER feasibility cannot be determined under
  the stated input rule.

  PASS with Notes — Architecture, data model, and interfaces are aligned for the active feature. The only limitation is the cross-
  branch ER feasibility check, which is not applicable due to the specified input pattern mismatch.
