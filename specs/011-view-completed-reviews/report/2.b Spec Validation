• PASS — Use Case Aligned with Constitution-Justified Additions.

  The active use case is UC-11, and the specification restates its main and alternate flow intent correctly: editors can view
  completed reviews only when all required reviews are complete, and editors are informed when reviews are still pending. The spec’s
  functional behavior is congruent with AT-UC11-01 and AT-UC11-02, including the pending path where full review presentation is
  withheld.

  Additional requirements are present beyond the literal UC/test text, including encrypted transport, protected-at-rest data
  handling, RBAC enforcement, explicit denial outcomes, auditability, concurrency/reliability constraints, and anonymized review
  presentation semantics. These are constitution-justified under Security and Confidentiality by Default, Least-Privilege RBAC,
  Explicit Error Communication, and Reliability/Recoverability principles, and are treated as policy constraints rather than new
  user-facing features.
