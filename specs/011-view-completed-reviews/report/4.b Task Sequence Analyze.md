• PASS — The task sequence contains no blocking dependencies. Foundational setup work precedes user-story tasks, and later tasks that
  reference earlier outputs (e.g., service wiring and recovery/checklist updates) appear after the relevant implementation phases.
  Parallel-marked tasks are compatible with the sequence, and no circular or forward-only dependencies are implied.
