| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
  |----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
  | C1 | Coverage Gap | HIGH | specs/011-view-completed-reviews/spec.md (SPR-001, SPR-002) | Security requirements for encrypted
  transport and encryption-at-rest are not mapped to any task. | Add explicit tasks for TLS enforcement validation and at-rest
  encryption verification in backend/data paths. |
  | D1 | Duplication | MEDIUM | specs/011-view-completed-reviews/tasks.md (T006, T026) | “Implement completion gating” appears both
  in Foundational (T006) and again in US2 (T026). | Consolidate into one task or change T026 to reference usage/config only. |
  | U1 | Underspecification | MEDIUM | specs/011-view-completed-reviews/tasks.md | Library-first justification requirement (AMR-003 /
  Constitution II) is not reflected in any task/checkpoint. | Add a lightweight task to document library-first choices or
  justification in plan/spec or code docs. |
  | G1 | Coverage Gap | MEDIUM | specs/011-view-completed-reviews/spec.md (RAR-004) | Backup/recovery requirement exists, but tasks
  only update recovery notes; no task covers verification/testing. | Add a task to validate recovery procedures for review visibility
  data path. |

  Constitution Alignment Issues:
  None detected. Plan and tasks reflect TDD, layered architecture, RBAC, and explicit error handling.

  Unmapped Tasks:
  None detected (all tasks map to requirements or constitutional gates), but some requirements lack tasks as noted above.

  Metrics:

  - Total Requirements: 24
  - Total Tasks: 36
  - Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task): 20/24 = 83%
  - Ambiguity Count: 0
  - Duplication Count: 1
  - Critical Issues Count: 0

  Next Actions

  - Add tasks covering SPR-001/SPR-002 and RAR-004 validation before implementation.
  - Resolve the duplicate completion-gating task (T006 vs T026) to avoid divergence.

  Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top 3 issues?

  ### Fix 

  Remediation suggestions (top 3 issues, no edits applied):

  1. Add explicit security validation tasks (SPR-001, SPR-002)
     Add two tasks in Phase 2 (Foundational) or Phase 5 (Hardening):
      - Validate TLS enforcement for UC-11 endpoints (server config + test)
      - Validate encryption-at-rest compliance for review data access paths (documented check + test)
  2. Remove/repurpose duplicate completion-gating task (T026)
     Keep T006 as the single implementation task for completion gating in backend/src/business/review-visibility/completion-gate.ts.
     Repurpose T026 to “wire/use completion gate in service layer” or delete it entirely to avoid double-implementation.
  3. Add backup/recovery verification task (RAR-004)
     Add a Phase 5 task to verify recovery procedures for review visibility data paths (e.g., add a short validation checklist or
     test run), not just notes.

  If you want me to apply these edits, confirm and I’ll update specs/011-view-completed-reviews/tasks.md with concrete task lines.

  ## Specification Analysis Report

  | ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
  |----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
  | D1 | Duplication | LOW | specs/011-view-completed-reviews/tasks.md (T038/T040) | Two separate recovery-related checklist tasks in
  the same file target overlapping “recovery verification” scope. | Merge into a single task or distinguish one as documentation
  update and the other as a validation run. |
  | U1 | Underspecification | MEDIUM | specs/011-view-completed-reviews/tasks.md (T039) | “Library-first justification note” lacks a
  location/section anchor inside plan.md. | Specify the exact section or add a new “Library-First Justifications” subsection in
  plan.md (as task output). |
