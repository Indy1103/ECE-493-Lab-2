## Question 1

Recommended: Option B - This best matches UC-11-S2 (“completed reviews are not presented in full”) and avoids premature editorial
  bias from partial data.

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | Show completed reviews but clearly mark that some required reviews are pending. |
  | B | Show no review content until all required reviews are complete; only show the pending message. |
  | C | Show only aggregate progress (e.g., “2 of 3 complete”) with no review content. |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words). |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or "recommended", or provide your own
  short answer.

  ### Response 

  B

## Question 2

Recommended: Option B - A generic unavailable outcome minimizes information disclosure (paper existence/assignment state) while
  still giving a clear user-visible denial, which is safer for protected editorial resources.

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | Return explicit unauthorized feedback for non-editor access attempts. |
  | B | Return a generic unavailable/denied outcome that does not disclose whether the paper or reviews exist. |
  | C | Return role-specific denial details only for authenticated users. |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words). |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or "recommended", or provide your own
  short answer.

  ### Response 

  B

  ## Question 3 

• Recommended: Option B - Reviewer identities are usually sensitive in peer-review contexts; anonymized display reduces bias and
  better protects confidentiality while still enabling editorial decisions.

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | Show each review with referee identity visible to the editor. |
  | B | Show reviews anonymized (content visible, referee identity hidden). |
  | C | Show identity only for designated senior-editor roles; otherwise anonymized. |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words). |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or "recommended", or provide your own
  short answer.

### Response
