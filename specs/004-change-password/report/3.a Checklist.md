## Required Remediation Summary (Natural Language)

**You need to add the following to the specification to satisfy this checklist:**

- Explicit requirements for how password-change requests are handled when sessions are expired or invalid across all entry paths, including user-visible authorization failure behavior.
- Explicit requirement statements covering encryption at rest for password-related data and encrypted backup handling for password-change-related records.
- Explicit recovery/compensation requirements for partial-failure timing during password change so rollback behavior is unambiguous when multi-step operations are interrupted.
- Measurable requirement statements that directly capture all applicable constitution-driven security/reliability obligations that materially affect this feature.

## Human-Readable Summary (Lab-Ready)

This checklist does not pass because required items are missing in authenticated-session failure handling detail, at-rest/backup encryption requirement coverage, and partial-failure recovery specificity, plus measurable constitution-traceability completeness. `/speckit.specify` should be re-run to add these required requirement statements so the feature spec meets mandatory authority expectations.

The following checklist IDs were detected and evaluated:
CHK001, CHK002, CHK003, CHK004, CHK005, CHK006, CHK007, CHK008, CHK009, CHK010, CHK011, CHK012, CHK013, CHK014
