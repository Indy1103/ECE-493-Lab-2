### Spec Analysis

PASS — Use Case Aligned with Constitution-Justified Additions.

The active use case is UC-04 (Change Account Password), and the specification restates its primary
flow and alternate validation-failure flow accurately: request password-change information, validate
it, update on valid input, confirm success, reject invalid input, keep the old password unchanged,
and allow retry. This is also consistent with AT-UC04-01 and AT-UC04-02.

Additional requirements do exist beyond the explicit UC/TestSuite text, including full-session
revocation after change, failed-attempt throttling, password history reuse prevention, audit logging
metadata, concurrency safety, backup/recovery expectations, encrypted transport, and no-plaintext
credential handling. These are not unjustified new features; they are Constitution-justified
security, reliability, validation, and auditability constraints under .specify/memory/constitution.md
(especially Security and Confidentiality by Default, Strict Validation and Explicit Error
Communication, Reliability/Recoverability, and audit gate requirements).

No requirement in the current [spec.md](http://spec.md/) needs to be classified as unjustified additional behavior.
