- Architecture Alignment Summary
[plan.md](http://plan.md/) is Aligned with Constitution intent. It uses the required React + TypeScript + PostgreSQL
direction, preserves three-layer boundaries, uses library-first choices, and explicitly covers
security (TLS, no plaintext handling, auditability), validation, and reliability/recovery
constraints. I did not find a direct constitutional violation in the proposed architecture or stack.
[data-model.md](http://data-model.md/) is largely congruent with [spec.md](http://spec.md/). AccountCredential, PasswordHistoryEntry,
PasswordChangeAttempt, and SessionRecord map to the specified password update, reuse prevention,
throttling/audit, session revocation, and recovery requirements. No clearly unjustified functional
than a local spec mismatch.
Interface Alignment Summary
contracts/password-change.openapi.yaml aligns with the spec’s functional scope: one authenticated
password-change operation, required fields (currentPassword, newPassword, confirmNewPassword), and
response paths for validation, auth/session failure, throttling, and operational failure. No extra
