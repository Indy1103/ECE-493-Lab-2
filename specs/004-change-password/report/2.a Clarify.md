### ./Speckit.Clarify

### Clarify Question 1

```c
 Recommended: Option B - Revoking all active sessions (including the current one) after a password
  change provides the strongest account-takeover protection and makes post-change authentication
  behavior unambiguous for testing.

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | Keep current session active; revoke other sessions |
  | B | Revoke all sessions and require immediate re-login |
  | C | Keep all sessions active until natural expiry |
  | D | Make session revocation configurable per deployment |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) |
```

**Response: B** 

### Clarify Question 2

```c
ecommended: Option A - Requiring current password verification is the standard control for in-
  session credential changes and materially reduces risk if a session is hijacked.

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | Require current password + new password + confirm new password |
  | B | Require new password + confirm only (no current password) |
  | C | Require current password + new password (no confirm field) |
  | D | Allow either current password or MFA challenge |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) |

```

**Response A**

### Clarify Question 3

```c
• Recommended: Option B - Adding per-account and per-IP throttling on password-change failures limits
  brute-force attempts without making normal use brittle.

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | No additional throttling for this endpoint |
  | B | Throttle failed attempts (per account + IP) with temporary lockout |
  | C | Throttle all attempts (success and failure) at a low fixed rate |
  | D | Hard lock account after N failures until admin reset |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or
  "recommended", or provide your own short answer.
```

**Response A**

### Clarify Question 4

```c
Recommended: Option B - Blocking reuse of the last 5 passwords is a common security baseline and
  gives a concrete, testable rule for UC-04 validation.

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | Allow immediate password reuse |
  | B | Disallow reuse of last 5 passwords |
  | C | Disallow reuse of last 10 passwords |
  | D | Disallow reuse within 365 days only |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or
  "recommended", or provide your own short answer.
```

**Response B**

### Clarify Question 5

```c
Recommended: Option B - Recording password-change attempt and outcome metadata in an audit log
  (without credentials) gives strong security observability and incident-response traceability with low
  implementation risk.

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | No dedicated audit logging for password changes |
  | B | Log each attempt outcome with timestamp, account ID, and source IP (no credential content) |
  | C | Log only successful password changes |
  | D | Log failures only |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or
  "recommended", or provide your own short answer.
```

**Response B**

### ./Speckit.Clarify

```c
Coverage summary:
  | Taxonomy Category | Status |
  |---|---|
  | Interaction & UX Flow | Clear |
  | Integration & External Dependencies | Clear |
  | Edge Cases & Failure Handling | Resolved |
  | Constraints & Tradeoffs | Outstanding |
  | Terminology & Consistency | Clear |
  | Completion Signals | Clear |
  | Misc / Placeholders | Clear |

  Notes on remaining gaps:

  - Domain & Data Model: password-history storage/retention lifecycle is still implicit.
  - Constraints & Tradeoffs: no explicit tradeoff statements (e.g., lockout duration vs usability).

  Recommendation: Proceed to /speckit.plan now; remaining gaps are low-risk and can be finalized during
  planning unless you want another clarify pass focused on data retention constraints.

  Suggested next command:

  - /speckit.plan
