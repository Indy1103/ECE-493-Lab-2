PASS — No Blocking Dependencies.

The task sequence is coherent and executable as written. Foundational prerequisites are placed before
story phases, and story phases are ordered before final hardening. Tasks that rely on prior outputs
(for example, implementation after test scaffolding, result-recording after test execution) appear
later in the sequence, and [P] markers are used where parallel execution is explicitly non-blocking.
No circular dependencies or forward references to outputs produced only by later tasks were
identified.
