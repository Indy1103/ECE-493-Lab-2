# Security-Reliability Checklist: Change Account Password

**Purpose**: Assess whether security and reliability requirements are complete, clear, consistent, and measurable for UC-04.
**Created**: 2026-02-09
**Feature**: `/Users/indy/Desktop/ECE 493 Lab/ECE 493 Lab 2/specs/004-change-password/spec.md`

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are authenticated-access requirements fully specified for all password-change entry paths, including expired/invalid session handling? [Completeness, Spec §Security & Privacy Requirements SPR-003, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK002 Are encryption requirements complete across in-transit, at-rest credential state, backups, and log redaction boundaries? [Completeness, Spec §Security & Privacy Requirements SPR-001/SPR-002, Spec §Reliability & Availability Requirements RAR-003]
- [ ] CHK003 Are reliability requirements complete for concurrent submissions, operational failure, and deterministic outcomes? [Completeness, Spec §Reliability & Availability Requirements RAR-001..RAR-004]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK004 Are rate-limit requirements quantified with explicit thresholds (attempt count, time window, lockout duration, reset behavior)? [Clarity, Spec §Security & Privacy Requirements SPR-007, Gap]
- [ ] CHK005 Is “explicit retry-capable error messaging” defined with concrete minimum content so wording quality is objectively reviewable? [Clarity, Spec §Reliability & Availability Requirements RAR-002, Gap]
- [ ] CHK006 Are audit-log field semantics and reason-code vocabulary defined clearly enough to avoid interpretation drift? [Clarity, Spec §Security & Privacy Requirements SPR-008, Plan §Phase 0]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK007 Are session requirements consistent between “active valid session required,” “verify current password,” and “revoke all sessions after success”? [Consistency, Spec §Functional Requirements FR-011, Spec §Security & Privacy Requirements SPR-003/SPR-005/SPR-006]
- [ ] CHK008 Do security feedback requirements stay consistent with the non-disclosure rule for sensitive details across all failure outcomes? [Consistency, Spec §Functional Requirements FR-007, Spec §Security & Privacy Requirements SPR-004]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK009 Are security/reliability success criteria measurable with explicit pass conditions rather than subjective language? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria SC-001..SC-005]
- [ ] CHK010 Are acceptance outcomes mapped unambiguously to security/reliability states (success, validation failure, throttled, operational failure)? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing, Spec §Reliability & Availability Requirements RAR-004, Gap]

## Scenario & Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK011 Are exception-flow requirements defined for lockout expiry and post-lockout recovery behavior? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §Security & Privacy Requirements SPR-007, Gap]
- [ ] CHK012 Are recovery requirements defined for partial-failure timing (for example, credential updated but session revocation/log write interrupted) so rollback/compensation expectations are explicit? [Coverage, Spec §Reliability & Availability Requirements RAR-002/RAR-004, Gap]

## Dependencies, Assumptions & Ambiguities

- [ ] CHK013 Are assumptions about existing password policy, session infrastructure, and backup procedures bounded with explicit ownership and source of truth? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §Dependencies]
- [ ] CHK014 Is any constitution-driven requirement reflected as a measurable requirement statement in the spec whenever it impacts security/reliability behavior? [Traceability, Plan §Constitution Check, Gap]

## Notes

- Mark items complete with `[x]` when requirement quality is satisfactory.
- Record clarification outcomes inline beside each item.
