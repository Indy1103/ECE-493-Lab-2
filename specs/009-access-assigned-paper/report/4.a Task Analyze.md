## Specification Analysis Report
  |----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
  transport enforcement/verification task(s) mapped to SPR-001. |
  tasks.md:14 | SPR-002 (sensitive linkage data protected at rest) has no explicit implementation or verification task
  | G1 | Coverage Gap | HIGH | specs/009-access-assigned-paper/spec.md:154, specs/009-access-assigned-paper/tasks.md:115 | SC-
  001 (95% within 5s) has no concrete performance test/measurement task. | Add a measurable performance validation task tied
  to SC-001. |
  | I1 | Inconsistency | MEDIUM | specs/009-access-assigned-paper/spec.md:103, specs/009-access-assigned-paper/plan.md:106 |
  Terminology drift: plan still says “unauthorized-generic,” while spec canonical term is UNAVAILABLE_OR_NOT_FOUND. |
  Normalize plan wording to canonical terms from FR-015. |
  | A1 | Ambiguity | MEDIUM | specs/009-access-assigned-paper/spec.md:100, specs/009-access-assigned-paper/spec.md:103 | FR-
  012 says “generic unavailable/not-found,” while FR-015 defines canonical UNAVAILABLE_OR_NOT_FOUND; phrasing can be
  interpreted inconsistently. | Use canonical term directly in FR-012 text. |
  | U1 | Underspecification | MEDIUM | specs/009-access-assigned-paper/tasks.md:115 | T036 is broad (“Run full backend test
  matrix”) without explicit pass criteria or command-level scope. | Add explicit success criteria/command scope for
  deterministic execution. |
  | U2 | Underspecification | LOW | specs/009-access-assigned-paper/tasks.md:118 | T039 is documentation-only for backup/
  restore/audit; does not explicitly validate restore behavior. | Add an explicit backup/restore verification task (or clarify
  reliance on existing validated process). |

    explicit task coverage.
  - Backup/recovery validation expectation from Principle VII is only weakly represented (documentation update task).

  ### Unmapped Tasks
  - None with zero semantic linkage; all tasks map to at least one story/requirement cluster.

  ### Metrics

  - Total Requirements: 34
  - Total Tasks: 39
  - Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task): 91% (31/34)
  - Ambiguity Count: 1
  - Duplication Count: 0
  - Critical Issues Count: 2

  ## Next Actions

  - Because CRITICAL issues exist, resolve them before /speckit.implement.
  - Recommended commands:
      - Refine requirements/coverage: /speckit.specify (security/performance wording + measurable validations)
      - Align plan terminology: /speckit.plan
      - Add missing coverage tasks: manually edit specs/009-access-assigned-paper/tasks.md for TLS, at-rest protection, and
        SC-001 performance validation.

  Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top 5 issues?

  ## Fixes

  Top 5 concrete remediation edits:
  1. Add explicit TLS enforcement/verification task (covers SPR-001, Constitution IV)
  - Insert in specs/009-access-assigned-paper/tasks.md Phase 2:
  - - [ ] T040 Implement and verify TLS-only enforcement for UC-09 endpoints in backend/src/presentation/referee-access/ and
  - - [ ] T041 [P] Add integration test asserting non-TLS requests are rejected for UC-09 routes in backend/tests/integration/


  - - [ ] T042 [P] Validate encrypted-at-rest handling for assignment/review-access linkage data and backups in infra/db/ and
  - - [ ] T043 [P] Add data-layer test or verification script for protected sensitive linkage fields in backend/tests/

  3. Add measurable performance validation task for SC-001

  - Insert in specs/009-access-assigned-paper/tasks.md Phase 6:
  - - [ ] T044 [P] Add performance test for UC-09 access path (95th percentile <= 5s) in backend/tests/integration/referee-
    access/performance.integration.test.ts
  - - [ ] T045 Record SC-001 measurement evidence and threshold result in specs/009-access-assigned-paper/quickstart.md

  4. Normalize plan terminology to spec canonical outcomes

  - Edit specs/009-access-assigned-paper/plan.md under “Design commitments”:
  - Replace “unauthorized-generic” with UNAVAILABLE_OR_NOT_FOUND and reference canonical set: UNAVAILABLE,
    UNAVAILABLE_OR_NOT_FOUND, SESSION_EXPIRED.

  5. Remove wording ambiguity in FR-012

  - Edit specs/009-access-assigned-paper/spec.md:
  - Change current phrase “generic unavailable/not-found outcome” to “canonical UNAVAILABLE_OR_NOT_FOUND outcome” so FR-012
    directly matches FR-015.

## Specification Analysis Report

  | ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
  |----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
  | I1 | Inconsistency | HIGH | specs/009-access-assigned-paper/tasks.md:21, specs/009-access-assigned-paper/tasks.md:119 |
  TLS enforcement (T040) is placed in Polish, but it is a foundational security control for protected endpoints. | Move TLS
  enforcement/verification tasks into Foundational (before story implementation). |
  | U1 | Underspecification | MEDIUM | specs/009-access-assigned-paper/tasks.md:115 | T036 (“Run full backend test matrix”)
  lacks explicit pass criteria/command granularity. | Add concrete command scope and pass criteria. |
  | U2 | Underspecification | MEDIUM | specs/009-access-assigned-paper/tasks.md:121 | T042 (“Validate encrypted-at-rest
  handling…”) is broad and not objectively test-scoped. | Add explicit verification steps/artifacts (what is checked and what
  constitutes pass/fail). |
  | D1 | Duplication | LOW | specs/009-access-assigned-paper/tasks.md:118, specs/009-access-assigned-paper/tasks.md:124 | Two
  separate quickstart documentation update tasks overlap (T039, T045). | Consolidate or differentiate intended outputs to
  avoid rework. |

  - One sequencing risk: security control placement (TLS task in Polish) should occur earlier to align with security-by-
    default intent.

  Metrics:

  - Total Requirements: 34
  - Total Tasks: 45
  - Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task): 100%
  - Ambiguity Count: 0
  - Duplication Count: 1
  - Critical Issues Count: 0

  ## Next Actions

  - No CRITICAL blockers; implementation can proceed.
  - Recommended improvements before /speckit.implement:

  1. Reorder TLS tasks to Foundational phase.
  2. Make T036 and T042 objectively testable with explicit pass criteria.
  3. De-duplicate or clarify T039 vs T045.

  - Suggested commands:
      - Manually edit specs/009-access-assigned-paper/tasks.md (task ordering/specificity cleanup)
      - Optional re-check: rerun /speckit.analyze after edits.
