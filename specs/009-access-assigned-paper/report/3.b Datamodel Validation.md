plan.md is Aligned with Constitution intent. It uses the mandated TypeScript/React/web API/PostgreSQL stack, explicitly
  with Constitution Principles I, III, IV, V, VI, and VII. I did not find constitution-violating architectural decisions.

  data-model.md is largely congruent with spec.md: core entities (RefereeAssignment, paper access, review form access) support
  UC-09 flows, and audit-event modeling is justified by reliability/audit requirements. One terminology mismatch exists: the
  data model’s audit outcome includes UNAUTHORIZED_GENERIC, while the updated spec canonical denial term is
  UNAVAILABLE_OR_NOT_FOUND; this is a consistency gap, not a new-feature expansion. No clearly unjustified extra behavior
  entities were identified.

  ### Interface Alignment Summary

  contracts/assigned-paper-access.openapi.yaml covers the required operations (list assignments and access selected
  assignment), and operation scope matches the feature. However, interface semantics are not fully aligned with the updated
  spec terminology: the contract error codes use PAPER_UNAVAILABLE and ASSIGNMENT_STALE instead of the spec’s canonical denial
  terms (UNAVAILABLE, UNAVAILABLE_OR_NOT_FOUND, SESSION_EXPIRED), and 404 currently conflates unavailable and unauthorized-
  generic without matching the spec’s canonical naming. This is a spec-contract congruence mismatch.

  ### Cross-Branch ER Feasibility Summary (if applicable)

  This step is not applicable yet because feature specs are still marked Draft (not all feature branches complete). A full
  unified ER feasibility determination should be deferred until completion status is reached across branches.

  Outcome: FAIL — architecture is constitution-aligned, but model/interface congruence with the current spec.md is not fully consistent due to terminology/contract mismatches.

  ## Fixes 
  
  Align with spec using their terms.

  ### Data Model Alignment Summary

  data-model.md is congruent with spec.md functional requirements. Entities map to required concepts (RefereeAssignment, paper
  access, review form access, and access audit events), support accepted-invitation/ownership constraints, session/security
  outcomes, and atomic paper+form access behavior. No missing required entity or unjustified extra functional entity was
  found; terminology now matches the spec’s canonical denial terms.

  ### Interface Alignment Summary

  The contract in ./contracts/assigned-paper-access.openapi.yaml aligns with spec.md scope: it exposes only the required
  operations (list assignments, access selected assignment), enforces authenticated access, and models the required success/
  failure classes including SESSION_EXPIRED, UNAVAILABLE, and UNAVAILABLE_OR_NOT_FOUND. No overexposed operation beyond the
  feature intent was identified.

  ### Cross-Branch ER Feasibility Summary (if applicable)

  This conditional step is not applicable yet because all feature specs discovered are still marked Draft, so “all feature
  branches complete” is not met. A definitive unified ER feasibility determination is therefore deferred under your rule.

  PASS with Notes — Architecture, model, and contract are aligned for the active feature; cross-branch ER aggregation remains
  pending completion status across branches.
