PASS — The task sequence contains no blocking dependencies.

All prerequisite relationships implied by the workflow are satisfiable in-order: setup precedes foundational work, foundational work precedes user-story phases, and polish/validation tasks appear after story implementation. Tasks that can run concurrently are explicitly marked [P], and no task requires an artifact that is only produced by a later task without an available prior path. I did not detect circular dependencies or undefined mandatory prerequisites that would prevent sequential execution.
