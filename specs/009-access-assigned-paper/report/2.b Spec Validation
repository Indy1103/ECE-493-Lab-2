• PASS — Use Case Aligned with Constitution-Justified Additions.

  The active use case is UC-09, and specs/009-access-assigned-paper/spec.md accurately restates its main success flow (request
  assigned papers, list shown, select paper, access paper + review form) and both documented alternative/exception flows (no
  assignments and unavailable selected paper), with matching traceability to AT-UC09-01/02/03 in TestSuite.md.

  The core functional requirements FR-001 through FR-010 are congruent with UC-09 intent and acceptance-test expectations.
  Additional functional behaviors in FR-011 through FR-014 (live revalidation on selection, non-enumerating unauthorized
  response, atomic paper/form failure handling, and expired-session unauthorized handling) go beyond explicit UC/TestSuite
  wording, but they are constitution-justified operational constraints rather than new features: they align with least-
  privilege RBAC and explicit/auditable authorization handling (Constitution Principle V), strict explicit error communication
  (Principle VI), and reliability/concurrency/confidentiality requirements (Principles IV and VII).

  Security, reliability, and maintainability requirements (SPR-*, RAR-*, AMR-*) are likewise Constitution-mandated or
  Constitution-permitted quality constraints, not unjustified user-visible feature expansion. I did not find behavior in the
  spec that is neither UC/TestSuite grounded nor justified by Constitution authority.
