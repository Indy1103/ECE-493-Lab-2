## Question 1

Recommended: Option A - Re-validating ownership/availability at selection time and hard-blocking access is the safest
  default; it prevents unauthorized access and keeps UC-09 alternative flows deterministic.

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | On selection, re-check assignment and paper availability live; if invalid, deny access, show explicit reason, and
  return updated assignment list. |
  | B | Honor the list snapshot for this request; allow one-time access even if assignment changed after list retrieval. |
  | C | Allow access to paper metadata only, but block full paper/review form when assignment changed. |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words). |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or "recommended", or provide
  your own short answer.

  ## Question 3 

  • Recommended: Option B - Return a generic not-available/not-found outcome for direct non-owned paper access attempts; this
  reduces information leakage while still giving explicit user feedback.

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | Show explicit “not authorized for this paper” for non-owned assignment access attempts. |
  | B | Show a generic “paper unavailable” outcome for non-owned direct access attempts, without confirming assignment
  existence. |
  | C | Redirect to assigned list with no specific error message. |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words). |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or "recommended", or provide
  your own short answer.

### Response 

B

## Question 4

• Recommended: Option A - Treat paper + review form as an atomic access unit for UC-09; it keeps reviewer workflow consistent
  and avoids partial states that complicate validation.

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | If review form retrieval fails, block paper access for that attempt and show a single unavailable message. |
  | B | Show paper content/metadata but block only the review form, with a partial-availability message. |
  | C | Allow paper access and queue review form retry in background, notifying user when form is ready. |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words). |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or "recommended", or provide
  your own short answer.

  ## Question 5

  • Recommended: Option A - On expired session, return 401, force re-authentication, and preserve no paper data in response;
  this is the standard secure behavior and is easy to test.

  | Option | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | A | Return 401/session-expired, redirect to login, and require retry after sign-in. |
  | B | Silent session refresh, then continue request automatically. |
  | C | Show assigned-list page with a generic error, no redirect. |
  | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words). |

  You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or "recommended", or provide
  your own short answer.
