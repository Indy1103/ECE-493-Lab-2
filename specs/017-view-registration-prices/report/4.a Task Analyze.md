## Specification Analysis Report
  | ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
  | C1 | Coverage Gap | HIGH | specs/017-view-registration-prices/spec.md:67-80; specs/017-view-registration-prices/tasks.md:35-125 |
  Several constitution-mandated requirements (security, reliability, auditability, RBAC, encryption) appear in the spec but have no
  explicit task coverage. | Add tasks for TLS enforcement checks, encryption-at-rest verification, audit logging, and RBAC validation
  in tasks.md. |
  | C2 | Underspecification | MEDIUM | specs/017-view-registration-prices/spec.md:67-74 | Security requirements include “sensitive
  data stored or updated by this feature” without specifying whether registration prices are sensitive, making expected controls
  ambiguous. | Clarify whether price list data is considered sensitive and which fields require encryption-at-rest. |
  | C3 | Underspecification | MEDIUM | specs/017-view-registration-prices/spec.md:74-79; specs/017-view-registration-prices/
  tasks.md:110-113 | Reliability requirements mention backup/restore impact and explicit error handling, but tasks only cover backup/
  restore and logging checks, not explicit user-visible error handling paths beyond 404. | Add task(s) to validate explicit error
  messaging for dependency outages and degraded state conditions. |
  | F1 | Inconsistency | LOW | specs/017-view-registration-prices/spec.md:49-55; specs/017-view-registration-prices/tasks.md:83-105 |
  Spec edge cases mention dependency outage and degraded state, but tasks don’t reference these scenarios directly. | Add a targeted
  integration test or e2e test for degraded/outage behavior. |

  Coverage Summary Table:
  | Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |
  |-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|
  | display-multiple-attendance-options | Yes | T010-T018 | Covered by US1 tasks |
  | inform-unavailable-prices | Yes | T019-T025 | Covered by US2 tasks |
  | encryption-at-rest | No | — | No task validating encryption policy |
  | RBAC-when-restricted | No | — | No task to validate authorization constraints |
  | concurrency-safety | Yes | T027 | Concurrency test task exists |
  | backup-restore-impact | Yes | T026 | Restore verification task exists |
  | explicit-error-messaging | Partial | T022, T025 | Covers 404; not outage/degraded cases |
  | auditability | No | — | No explicit audit log task |
  | layer-separation | Partial | T004-T006 | Interfaces defined, but no test for enforcement |
  Constitution Alignment Issues:
  - No direct constitution violations detected in spec or plan. Gaps are task coverage rather than conflicting requirements.


  - None detected. All tasks map to UC-17 user stories or constitution-driven hardening.

  Metrics:

  - Total Requirements: 17 (5 functional, 4 security, 4 reliability, 4 architecture)
  - Total Tasks: 29
  - Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task): ~65%
  - Ambiguity Count: 2
  - Duplication Count: 0
  - Critical Issues Count: 0

  ## Next Actions

  - No CRITICAL issues, but HIGH coverage gaps should be addressed before /speckit.implement.
  - Suggested commands:

  1. Run /speckit.tasks refinement to add missing security/RBAC/auditability tasks.
  2. Manually edit specs/017-view-registration-prices/tasks.md to add TLS/encryption/audit checks.

  Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top 3 issues?
