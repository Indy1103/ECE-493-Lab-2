• ### Architecture Alignment Summary
  specs/017-view-registration-prices/plan.md aligns with the Constitution’s required three-layer architecture, React + TypeScript
  requirements. No constitution-violating decisions are present, and the plan explicitly preserves public access to conference
  information.

  ### Data Model Alignment Summary

  specs/017-view-registration-prices/data-model.md is congruent with specs/017-view-registration-prices/spec.md:
  RegistrationPriceList and RegistrationPrice map directly to required concepts, support published vs unavailable states, and include
  attributes needed for attendance-type pricing. No extra entities or relationships introduce new functional behavior.

  ### Interface Alignment Summary

  specs/017-view-registration-prices/contracts/openapi.yaml exposes a single read-only endpoint to retrieve the published price list
  and a 404 for unavailable prices. Inputs/outputs map to the spec’s functional requirements and do not enable functionality beyond
  UC-17.

  ### Cross-Branch ER Feasibility Summary

  Not applicable. Feature branches are not all complete, so a cross-branch ER aggregation assessment cannot be performed.

  Outcome: PASS
