• PASS — The task sequence contains no blocking dependencies. All prerequisites are positioned earlier in the sequence, with Phase 1
  setup preceding foundational work, and foundational work preceding the user-story phases. Tests are scheduled before implementation
  within each story, and hardening tasks appear after story completion. Parallel markers do not introduce hidden dependencies. The
  task flow is coherent and executable as written.
